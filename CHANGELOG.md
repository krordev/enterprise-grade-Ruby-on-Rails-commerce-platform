*   Add Inverse Aspect Ratio To Product Image Fields (#118)

    Populate the `:image_inverse_aspect_ratio` automatically using
    Dragonfly, in order to reduce the amount of requests made to S3 in order
    to find out this information.

    Tom Scott

*   Exclude docs/ from the gem build

    Matt Duffy

*   Ensure Tags Are Unique

    When inserting tags into a taggable document, make sure their values are
    unique. This addresses an issue where incorrect tag counts were being
    displayed on the storefront.

    Fixes #112
    Tom Scott

*   Display Referrer URL in tooltip on Order Attributes in Admin

    Due to the length of URLs being displayed on Order Attributes in the
    admin they will potentially break layout. Now they are displayed within
    a tooltip behind a "View" link click. The resulting tooltip will prompt
    the user to copy the contents of a text box containing the URL.

    Fixes #60

*   Fix incorrect URL for workarea support on CLI documentation

    Matt Duffy

*   Add checkout confirmation append point (#76)

    Adds append point below default order confirmation text.

*   Fix blank default category in admin ProductViewModel (#55)

    `ProductViewModel#default_category` now protects against a `nil` value
    for the default category before passing its value into a view model.

    Fixes #33
    Tom Scott

*   Replace App Template Command With Install Generator in Upgrade Docs

    In the upgrade guide for v3.4, we're instructing users to apply an app
    template which no longer exists. Instead of using the app template, we
    now rely on a generator called `workarea:install` to place the expected
    files into your Rails app directory, so update the command in docs to
    avoid confusion.

Workarea 3.4.16 (2019-09-17)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Ensure test only asserts product details for product system test

* Parse URL When Ensuring CORS for Direct Uploads

  The `request.url` returns the full URL, with path included. This isn't
  valid for a CORS header, which needs just the scheme, host, and port if
  it's non-standard. Update the `DirectUpload.ensure_cors!` method to
  parse out those pieces of the URL and re-assemble it for the CORS
  header and ID.

* Use current URL for direct upload CORS headers (#20)

  Direct uploads can fail locally if your `Workarea.config.host` is not
  set to the domain you are currently using in the browser. To prevent
  this, instead of reading from the configuration when ensuring CORS
  headers on the S3 bucket, use the URL from the request for S3 CORS config.
  Addresses a problem whereby changing the domain (either accidentally or
  on-purpose) causes direct uploads to fail, since it can't create the
  proper CORS headers needed to transmit files into the bucket directly.



Workarea 3.4.15 (2019-09-04)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Customize Search Queries That Return an Exact Match (#22)

    It's currently possible to customize search queries that return an exact
    match, but instead of seeing the customized results when you run the
    query, you'll be redirected to the product page since the
    `StorefrontSearch::ExactMatches` middleware stops further middleware
    execution and sets a redirect to the product path. To resolve the issue,
    Workarea will now ignore this middleware if a customization is present
    on the search response.
    
    Discovered by @ryaan-anthony of **Syatt Media**. Thanks Ryan!

*   Add Generic Activity Partials (#4)

    Empty results were still being seen in the trash when a model that
    doesn't explicitly have an activity partial defined is encountered. This
    is due to the `render_activity_entry` helper rescuing an
    `ActionView::TemplateError` to return a blank string. To resolve this
    issue, models that are tracked by `Mongoid::AuditLog`, without an
    explicit activity partial defined will be rendered using a generic
    partial, showing the class name and ID of the audited model, as
    something to render in the listing so that pages of blank results
    aren't shown.

*   Remove minitest plugin (#12)

    This existed for CI purposes on Bamboo, and we don't need it here after
    moving to Github. It has been moved the `workarea-ci` gem for backwards
    compatibility.

*   Fix Deep Duplication of Swappable Lists (#13)

    The `Workarea::SwappableList` class does not get duplicated correctly
    when `Workarea.config.deep_dup` is used. This was observed while using
    multi-site and attempting to change a swappable list for only one site.
    Define the `#deep_dup` method to return a new object instead of referencing
    the existing one.


*   Publish Releases In Background Job

    When a release is published, but has too many changes, it can cause a
    request timeout because it can't be fully published within the allotted
    15 seconds in production. To prevent this, Workarea now runs all release
    publishing in a background job. The success flash message for when a
    release is published has been updated to inform users that changes may
    take a little while to apply.
    
    Fixes #1

*   Remove references to v2 from Developer docs

*  	Fix Incorrect Currency in Mongoid Money Types
    
    Workarea's default values for the Money fields in `Pricing::Override`
    didn't previously change currency when `Money.default_currency` is
    re-configured in process (like in the case of a multi-site application
    with multiple currencies). Ensure that the correct currency is used by
    using an Integer type as the default, which will get converted into a
    Money type at runtime.

* 	Change URL used to download product images for seed data

*   Get GitHub Actions CI up and running

    Move the **admin.shipping_details** append point from `shippings#show`

    `shippings#show` partial to reduce confusion since it is no longer being
    used.

*   Add upgrade guides index page to docs site

    Provide an index page of upgrade guides so that external docs
    (specifically the docs for the upgrade plugin) can link to it.

    Also update the 3.4 upgrade guide to follow the file and document naming
    conventions used by the release notes.

    Chris Cressman

*   Fix Internal Server Error Page Not Rendering JSON

    When an Internal Server Error is requested via `/500.json`, another
    error occurs when attempting to render the view for that request,
    because there's no `internal` template. This is not how our error
    handler is supposed to work, any format should be acceptable to render a
    404 or 500. The syntax of the `respond_to` block in `#render_error_page`
    has been altered so that Workarea serves the custom content HTML when an
    HTML error occurs (e.g., most user-facing browser errors), and an empty
    body with a 500 error in the status code is returned for all other
    formats.

*   Fix Order Status Lookup Route

    The `/orders/status/:order_id/:postal_code` was being resolved by the
    `#show` action of OrdersController, when it really should be served by
    `#lookup`. Change the route and add a test ensuring that the route is
    being handled properly.

*   Prevent Empty Results In Trash

    Remove a check for whether a given audit log entry is `#restorable?` in
    on the **/admin/trash** page to prevent empty results clogging up the
    pagination. Without this, admins will see blank pages if they delete
    enough nav taxon/release records at the same time.

*   Update Contributing Guides (#8)

    Update the guides in the "Contribute" section of Workarea's
    documentation to reflect the new process of GitHub Issues, Pull
    Requests, and the "fork-and-pull" model that developers will be using to
    contribute code and docs to the platform from now on. This also includes
    a bit about using `puma-dev` to preview documentation locally, because I
    thought that was useful.

    Closes #7
    Tom Scott

*   Remove help articles (#13)

    * Remove all Help articles

    These articles are largely outdated and provide little more than basic,
    general information about the expected user input on a given page.

    For more complex actions in the Admin we favor tooltips.

    This work does include one help article, How To Create Help Articles, to
    allow Admins and Developers a chance to build out this section for their
    specific purposes.

    Closes #5

    * Fix output of Help Article code blocks

    By using Redcarpet to render supplied markdown, rather than Haml's
    `:markdown` filter, we can force the article's output through the
    renderer's `hard_wrap` option, which will preserve intended whitespace
    throughout the article.

Workarea 3.4.11 (2019-08-06)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Use `#camelize` over `#classify` when loading report class for export

    The use of `#classify` causes errors to be thrown during export of
    a report class that is plural, e.g. WishListProducts. This causes
    the export to fail and the user to not receive the export email.

*   Improve Accuracy of CSV Import Test

    The unit test written for configuring the charset of any CSV files
    imported into the system was not accurate, as it was not actually
    testing what would happen if the configuration was in place. The test
    continued to pass, however, becuase it turns out that it's very
    difficult to conjure up an ASCII string in Ruby, which is purely UTF8.
    Even editing the CSV file in Vim produced a compatible String when read
    into Ruby, so the test still wasn't accurate. The only way to get the
    test to fail in an expected way was to actually include the CSV file
    given to us from URBN, which was quickly fixed by setting the
    `:encoding` option on CSV imports.

    ECOMMERCE-7012
    Tom Scott

*   Filter Blank Data From Average Order Value Report

    Since the Average Order Value report divides orders by revenue in a
    MongoDB aggregation, neither of these numbers can be 0, otherwise a
    divide by zero error is thrown. To prevent this, Workarea now omits any
    `Metrics::SalesByDay` documents from the aggregation if their orders
    and/or revenue are 0.

    ECOMMERCE-7016
    Tom Scott

*   Update GeoIP Headers

    For apps that are using the GeoIP 2 database, the headers have changed
    to a slightly different syntax, and some of them output different values
    than they used to. Update `Workarea::Geolocation` to handle both
    versions of the GeoIP database and to look up the subdivision code by
    its name through the Countries gem.

Workarea 3.4.10 (2019-07-23)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Allow Development Access to Assets Admin Index

    Developers shouldn't need an AWS keypair to view the
    **/admin/content_assets** index. Workarea will now only call
    `DirectUpload.ensure_cors!` if the S3 bucket has been configured,
    so one can still browse the page.

    ECOMMERCE-7014
    Tom Scott

*   Replace "Views" with "Searches" on Search Insights

    For insights revolving around search, use the more apt term "Searches",
    which maps to the actual `searches` in the resultset, instead of
    "Views". This fixes an issue where insights with blank views/searches
    were showing up on the search dashboards.

*   Improve "Commerce Model" diagram & text

*   Omit `nil` Options From Product Cache Key

    The `#details_in_options` method, meant for including any options passed
    to the `CacheKey` so long as they appear in details, would error if the
    name of an option was `nil`. Workarea now ensures that those options
    will be omitted.

    ECOMMERCE-6986
    Tom Scott

*   Remove Support For Restoring Taxons Without Parents

    `Navigation::Taxon` documents whose parents no longer exist cannot be
    restored because they are too dependent on their external relations,
    such as `:parent_ids`. This causes issues on restore when one attempts
    to restore a child taxon without restoring its parent. To prevent this
    potential issue, taxons are never allowed to be restored from the trash.
    The recommended alternative is to just create another taxon.

*   Fix Encoding Errors on Product Import

    Allow users to specify a source encoding for CSV files that are being

    that's the charset Workarea renders content with in the browser, but
    the source can now be configured to prevent errors when importing CSV.

*   Fix time zone configuration article

    Rails needs this to be configured earlier than in an initializer, so
    this needs to be in general Rails config in `config/application.rb`.

    When done in an initializer, `Time.zone` will not be set accurately,
    so models loaded out of the database will have `Time` fields in UTC.

*   Add Pagination to Shipping Services Admin Index

    When an application has more than 100 shipping services in the database,
    only the first 100 would show on the index. Additionally, such a large
    query should be paginated. Render the `workarea/admin/shared/pagination`
    partial at the bottom of the `<table>` containing all services and
    paginate the collection of services that are queried for in the
    controller.

*   Stop Premailer from automatically combining properties

    When possible Premailer will combine separated properties, like
    `background-image`, `background-position`, etc, into one, single
    property. This causes issues in Yahoo, at least, and presumably other,
    inferior mail clients. It's best to stop this behavior, which gives more

    In the [countries](https://github.com/hexorx/countries) gem,
    some subdivisions in a country (what Workarea calls "regions") do not
    have a `:name` field associated with them. If this occurs, dive into the
    `#translations` hash and look for the name of the region within the
    current i18n locale.

*   Prevent Customer Service Taxonomy Duplication

    In the footer navigation, the "Customer Service" header was duplicated
    now that the `:show_starting_taxon` option for content blocks defaults

    content in the layout so that the heading doesn't show up twice.

*   Fix Search Settings Clearing When Not Submitted From Main Form

    With the **workarea-swatches** plugin comes a form that updates a single
    value on the search settings, in contrast to the main search settings
    form which updates all values at once. This form's action URL is just
    `PATCH /admin/search_settings`, which does some massaging of the params
    and inadvertently causes `nil` values to be contained in the attributes
    hash for updating when those params are not included in the request.
    Workarea now runs `.compact` on the Hash of attributes generated by this
    controller action, before it's mass-assigned into `Search::Settings.current`.
    This prevents the params from getting cleared out, and fixes any kind of partial
    updates on the `/admin/search_settings` endpoint.

*   Fixes for Chrome 75

    Chrome 75 enables W3C mode by default, which breaks lots of stuff.

    This also adds configuration via ENV variables for which options and
    args to pass to Chrome when running tests.

    `Workarea.config.headless_chrome_options` turns out to be poorly named
    because the Selenium driver accepts both args and options, and both
    may need to be configured to fix problems in Chrome. In a future minor
    release, we'll allow both args and options to be defined in
    `Workarea.config`. For now, lots of people are using them so let's not
    break in a patch.

*   Improve Consistency of Order Pricing Display

    When viewing an order summary in the storefront, the price of each item
    matches its original price, with no discounts applied. This is somewhat
    confusing as the totals don't add up to the subtotal of the order. The
    order summary page now renders the `item.total_price` so that these
    totals match up in the end.

*   Prevent Double Application of Order-Level Discounts When Determining Packages

    In the `Workarea::Packaging` class, the subtotal of all shippable items
    already includes the order-level discounts after pricing is performed,
    since `Order::Item#total_value` is not the total prior to discounts,
    only tax and shipping. However, order-level discounts were being
    summed and deducted from the `Packaging#total_value`, resulting in a
    miscalculation of the total price of the Order. This problem doesn't
    manifest itself until there are a sufficient number of shipping tiers
    (at the very least, 3), because either the top or bottom tier will be
    used anyway. Remove the code for subtracting order-level discounts from
    the total value of the package, so that the proper shipping price will
    be displayed to the user in checkout.

*   Fix New Release Form Creating Duplicates

    The "with a new release" selection on the release selector pops up a
    mini form which prompts the user for the name of their new release. This
    form is dismissed if the user clicks the button, but still allows
    potential user input (including multiple submits), causing duplicate
    releases to be accidentally created if one hits enter _and_ clicks the
    "Add" button before the page refreshes. Prevent this by adding
    `data-disable-with` to the button so that it can't be submitted twice in
    the same request cycle.

*   Reorganize the Docs Taxonomy

    The developer documentation taxonomy was originally developed based on how
    we think about the problems - _not_ how the end-user uses the content.

    Based on OSS project docs research, analytics, developer survey results,
    card sorting and user interviews - this updated taxonomy focuses more on
    succinct groupings of content that allow the _end-user_ to associate the
    code and content more quickly.

    Further refinement based on usage patterns and planned additions are expected
    over the upcoming releases to continue to align the taxonomy with how
    developers utilize the content.

*   Fix Exports Index Not Displaying After Promo Code Export

    When a list of promo codes is exported, the data file exports index page
    had trouble rendering a link to the collection, since there's no index
    page for promo codes. Workarea will now render the non-linked name of
    the object being exported, instead of attempting to generate a URL that
    doesn't exist.

*   Omit Blank Sorts From Product Search Index

    Sorts configured in the product entries in Elasticsearch could
    potentially get quite long and unruly if the product was categorized in
    many places, but not set up for sorting in those categories. This causes
    an error in Elasticsearch if allowed to grow out of control, since its
    field limit for a single document is 1000. Workarea now removes any
    categories in the `sorts` for which a product position in `product_ids`
    cannot be found. This reduces the amount of noise in the documents and
    prevents scaling errors like this one.

    ECOMMERCE-6912

*   Fix Date and DateTime Picker UIs default setting on page load

    Due to the issues outlined
    [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date#Timestamp_string)
    we are unable to accurately set a default date, on page load, for date
    or datetime pickers for all browsers.

    As a fallback we do our damnedest to grok at least the date from the
    datetime string passed in from Ruby.

    ECOMMERCE-6909
    Curt Howard

*   Fix Product Categorization With Missing Indexes

    When the Storefront index is missing,
    `Search::Storefront::Product.find_categories` throws an exception due to
    the **400 Bad Request** error it receives from the Elasticsearch server.
    To prevent this and any other strange Elasticsearch errors from
    affecting this method (which is not supposed to throw an exception),
    rescue the base `Elasticsearch::Transport::Transport::ServerError` class
    rather than any subclasses we find are thrown during this request.

*   Disable Permissions Management When User is a Super-Admin

    When a user has super-admin privileges in admin, it was previously
    possible to attempt removing admin access as well as access to areas of
    the admin, but these values would just get re-set after the form
    completed anyway. Workarea now sets all checkboxes on the permissions
    page to `disabled`, and renders a warning message above the form stating
    that you cannot change permissions for users who are super-admins. It
    also instructs the admin how to disable super-admin for a user in order
    for this page to function normally.

    In some very unusual edgecases a releasable can become nil, for example if the document is deleted without callbacks or if an embedded document is overwritten. In these cases the release cannot be viewed in the admin. This change allows the release to still be viewed if some of the changesets have invalid releasables.

    Testing `Analytics::User.orders_per` during daylight savings time
    results in the test failing because of the hour difference between the
    current time and the duration of `7.days.ago` in the test. Ensure that
    this assertion always runs on a date that isn't in DST so the test won't
    fail on the day DST changes next year.

*   Add Generic Summary Partial to Fix Error When Bulk Deleting Shipping Services Past Threshold

    When the `Workarea.config.bulk_action_deletion_threshold` is surpassed
    in a query for shipping services to be bulk-deleted, the page that is
    being redirected to expects the models being deleted to have
    **_summary.html.haml** partials co-located in their respective views
    directory for the controller. This isn't the case for shipping services,
    which (along with other models we may wish to bulk-delete) doesn't have
    much information other than the name of the model. For these items,
    introduce a generic **workarea/admin/shared/summary** which links to the
    model and provides its name (or BSON ID if no `#name` method is defined)
    as well as its type in the auxiliary summary info.

*   Add `workarea:services:clean` for Removing Data

    This task runs `docker-compose down -v`, which will remove volumes
    associated with the application. It's useful when transitioning between
    v3.3 and v3.4, so the Mongo data doesn't become corrupted, but should
    only be used if you're OK with your data getting deleted.

    Additionally, an environment variable called `$COMPOSE_ARGUMENTS` was
    introduced to provide a means of passing command-line arguments to the
    `docker-compose` commands that are run using these tasks. For example:

    COMPOSE_ARGUMENTS="--remove-orphans" rails workarea:services:up

*   Fix Issue With Sale Price Creation

    In the admin when creating a new Pricing::Price, the messaging says `Sale Price (defaults to regular)`, but when left blank the Sale Price will be saved as 0.00.

    This fix ensure the value to be cast as nil in the database for the following scenarios:
    - Creating a new price
    - Editing an existing price
    - Creating a new pricing SKU with prices

*   Add indexes for defaults scopes that don't have corresponding indexes

    If models have a default scope, they should have a corresponding index. This may not always be caught by the base test suite, but can affect things like console usage, rake tasks, decorations, etc.

*   Validate Product Rule Lucene Query Syntax

    When invalid Lucene queries are saved into product rules, an error would
    occur when attempting to browse the category because the query was never
    checked for valid syntax. As part of the validation process for product
    rules, run a `Search::CategoryBrowse` query for the rule being created
    or edited, and add an error to the model if Elasticsearch responds with
    a server error (5xx) HTTP status. This prevents the rule from being saved
    on the product list in the first place.

    ECOMMERCE-6849
    Tom Scott

*   Disable Slug Input On Released Pages

    Set `disabled: true` on slug inputs when making changes within a
    release, and add help text to explain why it's disabled. Since slugs
    cannot be changed within a release, having this as a field a user can
    type into created a confusing experience.

*   Fix bug with non-inline Datepicker UI

    A regression was introduced when adding the Quick Range feature to the
    datepicker.

    This commit also cleans up the `WORKAREA.datepickerFields` and

*   Fix Upgrading With App Template

    Some errors were observed when using the `rails app:template` task with
    the built-in app template for upgrade purposes, since there are a
    significant amount of changes in the app template for v3.4 (like
    auto-configuration). Workarea has replaced the usage of `@app_name` with
    the `#app_name` method to ensure that it's set before attempting to
    perform text processing operations, and the template will no longer
    write to `Gemfile` if it doesn't have to.

*   Prevent Logging Controller Parameters in Logstash

    Logstasher was previously configured to send controller params in
    Logstash logs, but this caused errors in Elasticsearch as each new param
    became a new mapping as it was indexed. This very quickly exhausted the
    amount of mappings allowed within the Elasticsearch index. Workarea no
    longer enables this field out of the box, so that logstash will continue
    to work as normal.

*   Fix audit log entries not being recorded in Sidekiq jobs

    This is a carryover from the v2.x days. We've never updated the app to log the current user through Sidekiq, so with new functionality like bulk edit, delete, trash, etc we'll need work done in the background to be recorded as well.

    ECOMMERCE-6812
    Ben Crouse

*   Fix export samples for large collections

    The `skip` that is done to get random samples can be quite slow if
    MongoDB needs to page. A simpler way is to grap the first N number of
    documents since they don't really need to be random.

*   Fix Puma clustering in development mode

    A combination of Puma forking, Rails constant reloading cause Sidekiq callbacks to miss workers that exist in the host app.

    Rails doesn't default to doing clustered mode in development (for good reason, the forking slows things down) so we'll allow that to be configured by an ENV var for hosting but default to not clustered in the platform.

    In `WORKAREA.cloneableRows`, the `id` of any `<input>` element that is
    cloned will be updated to have the suffix of `_cloned`, in order to
    differentiate it from the original element. This logic has been carried
    over to `<label>` elements so the `for` and `id` values match for each
    cloned row.

*   Set Default `From:` Address at Time of Delivery

    For multi-site implementations, the `config.email_from` address could not be
    overwritten based on the configuration of different sites, due to the
    way it was being set in the `Workarea::ApplicationMailer`. As a result,
    an incorrect email address appeared as the "From:" of certain multi-site
    applications. This has been resolved by introducing a lambda as the
    value for the `default from:` in all emails delivered by the out-of-box
    mailers, evaluated when the message is delivered. Ensures that each mail
    always uses the most up-to-date configuration.

*   Disable Shipping Method Selection When Processing

    Prevent shipping method from getting selected when Workarea is still
    pricing the order. Additionally, set the `WORKAREA.shippingServices.requestTimeout`
    to '1' in order to prevent any other parallel shipping estimate requests from
    causing a locked order and showing strange errors to the user, including
    flashes of error text and incorrect shipping price totals in the
    summary. By disabling the radio input whenever a shipping service is
    selected, and re-enabling it when the request is complete, the scenario
    of obtaining an incorrect shipping price and thus being kicked back to
    shipping to re-select is no longer possible to trigger.

    ECOMMERCE-6692
    Tom Scott

*   Prevent Disconnection Between Shipping Method Selection And Shipping Price

    Ensure order locking doesn't redirect the user to the `/cart` route,

*   Search Countries By Unofficial Name

    Using an address verification or geocoding service (like Bing maps)
    which doesn't conform to the ISO3166 standard of naming and referencing
    countries caused an error when the address came back to Workarea. This
    is due to the fact that these services can potentially use the
    "unofficial" name of the country, like in the case of "United States"
    (unofficial) vs "United States of America" (official). To resolve this,
    Workarea's `Country.search_for` method now looks through the list of
    unofficial names (case-insensitively) if no matches can be found in the
    official name, alpha2, or alpha3 shorthand codes.

*   Do not suppress analytics callbacks for admin in development environments

    In dev you're probably safe firing analytics callbacks for admin because you shouldn't have the production configuration for analytics services, otherwise a bigger concern would be firing non-admin events in dev.

*   Don't set release when managing comments

    Commenting on a releasable while editing a release can cause the loss
    of release changes when a comment updates the subscribers of the
    commentable. Not setting release when adding comments prevents this.

    ECOMMERCE-6701

*   Mark store credit authorize transactions as purchase actions

    When managing orders, particularly refunds and cancellations, store
    credit would not be processed correctly since there is no capturing
    of store credit funds. Setting the authorization transaction as a
    purchase transaction allows orders with store credit to be canceled
    and refunded as expected

    This guide goes into depth on how to manipulate search filters for

    types, programmatically sort filters, and omit filters from display.

*   Fix Inability to Remove Navigable Association from Taxon Through the Admin

    When associating part of the taxonomy with a "navigable" page, category,
    or product, admins were not able to remove the association later on if
    they so chose. The `Navigation::Taxon#navigable` property would only be
    set if a navigable object was sent over in params, and this contrasts
    with how Select2 is implemented to send over a blank value when no
    selection is made. Workarea will now always set the navigable to the
    contents of the params.

*   Update font-url() Example in Email Template

    The current example for adding a font to emails uses Ruby interpolation
    to inject the URL to the font in CSS. However, Rails' out-of-box SCSS
    integration already includes a `font-url()` helper that will automatically
    load the Sprockets fingerprinted asset in production, and look through plugin
    and gem paths for the asset partial string.

*   Add caching for reports

    Default is 1 hour, cache key includes the current hour. So report data
    will be refreshed at minimum on the hour, every hour.

    ECOMMERCE-6630
    Ben Crouse

*   Make Tags Searchable For All Models

    Ensure that if a model can be tagged, it can be searched by that tag in
    admin. This is accomplished by returning the tags Array in the base
    `Search::Admin#keywords` method by default, rather than the empty Array
    that it was defined to return previously. Ensure all subclasses of
    `Search::Admin` that define a keywords method also call `super`, so
    this feature will be available to those models as well.

    Additionally, with this change Workarea now includes the `model.id` in
    keywords, so searching for a BSON ID of any model that's indexed in
    admin search will return the model to you.

*   Expire Extra Admin Cookies

    The `:analytics` and `:cache` cookies were not being expired at the
    same time as `:user_id`, resulting in those cookies lingering around
    after an admin's session has expired. This causes errors when developers
    are testing things related to cache and analytics, because those cookies
    prevent the aforementioned functionality from succeeding. Workarea now
    expires these cookies at the same time as the user ID, rather than just
    when the session no longer exists.

    ECOMMERCE-6369
    Tom Scott

*   Remove legacy analytics code

    All functionality from the Analytics module has been reimplemented in
    Metrics, Reports, and Insights so this is dead code now. This is code

    straightforward.

    Typically, the `Catalog::ProductImage#option` value is a String, but it
    can be nil when images are uploaded programmatically, such as through
    the bulk upload or CSV import tools, or potentially through a custom
    data integration of some kind. Ensure that this image option is converted
    to a String in the `Storefront::OptionThumbnailsViewModel#images_without_options`
    method, so that the `option_thumbnails` product template works as
    expected.

*   Inform Admins Of Default Category Cache

    If an admin changes a product's calculated default category and goes to
    view the product immediately afterward, they will not see their changes
    reflected in the "Default Category" pane of the product's
    categorizations page. Add text to the help bubble explaining this
    behavior, since this data is cached at a very low level and cannot be
    changed for this admin page.

*   Force SSL In Deployed Environments

    Set `config.force_ssl = true` to enable HSTS and prevent non-secure

    page. Previously, since no `:size` param was applied, Elasticsearch
    defaulted to returning 10 results.

*   Disable scrollToButton When Rendered Within Dialog

    The `scrollToButton` module automatically scrolls down the page towards
    the anchor that the href of the link was pointing to, but when this
    occurs within a dialog it can accidentally cause a scroll to the wrong
    element. This manifested itself when the reviews and quickview plugins
    were installed and the "Read Reviews" link was clicked while a product
    was being quick-viewed.

*   Only Link Primary Navigation For Navigable Taxons

    Taxons that are not navigable cannot be rendered with a `#link_to`,
    because the href argument passed into the helper is `nil` and Rails is
    converting that to the URL of the current page, making it appear as
    though the link is pointing to the wrong place. Use `<span>` tags with
    the same `.primary-nav__link` classes as the primary nav links in place
    of `<a>` tags so these items are not clickable, but can be styled the
    same as regular links.

    This gem is no longer maintained, so we're vendoring it in the same
    freedom patches file as the `.all_tags` monkey-patch that was made a
    few years prior to now. As a result, Workarea applications can use v2.0
    of the `json` gem, which implements the newer [RFC 7159](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159.html)
    specification of the JSON standard. Using this newer specification
    allows other top-level objects like `nil` instead of throwing an error
    when an Array or Hash is not passed into `JSON.generate`.

*   Sort SVG Icons By Filename in Style Guide

    The order that SVG icons appeared in the storefront and admin style
    guides was dependent on which order the plugin gems loaded, because
    there was no alphanumeric sort being applied after all icon path names
    were consolidated together. Workarea now sorts the `#style_guide_icons`
    helper method by each icon's filename, ensuring that the icons are no
    longer re-sorted based on whether a plugin or app overrode any.

*   Mark Individual Prices Within a SKU As On-Sale

    Pricing SKUs have an `#on_sale` flag that determines whether to use the
    `Pricing::Price#sale` field or the `Pricing::Price#regular` field when
    pricing a given item. However, this determination can only be made on a
    SKU level, and not within individual price tiers. To do that, Workarea
    3.4 introduces the `Pricing::Price#on_sale` field, which takes on the
    value of the parent `Pricing::Sku#on_sale` if it's not set explicitly on
    the price.

    ECOMMERCE-6118

*   Search By Variant Name in "Jump-To" Autocomplete

Workarea 3.3.11 (2018-10-16)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Prefer Most Specific Tax Rate When All Parameters Are Given

    Providing a country and region to `Tax::Category.find_rate` when there
    are rates that exist on the postal code level would previously return
    those more specific postal code rates instead of the "general"
    `Tax::Rate` for the state. Workarea now ensures that the `:postal_code`
    on the rate is blank when a postal code is not given to the `.find_rate`
    method.

*   Ensure Redirect Path is Encoded Before Persisting

    The `Navigation::Redirect#sanitize_path` callback could potentially
    throw a `URI::InvalidURIError` if the given path is not valid. Workarea
    now checks if the argument passed in is URI-encoded, according to the
    specifications of [RFC 2396](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt). If it
    has not already been encoded, `Navigation::Redirect.sanitize_path` will
    call `URI.encode` to make sure that an error won't be thrown when
    parsing as a URI.

    Logged-in admin users are no longer bound by the `Rack::Attack` rules
    for abusive clients. Add a safelist rule that checks whether the `:admin`
    cookie is present and `true`. If so, the request is "safelisted",

    Tom Scott

*   Fix issues with Order::Item#current_unit_price with some discounts

    The BuySomeGetSome discount type can cause issues with calculating unit
    price at the price adjustment level. To alleviate these issues, unit
    price for an item is calculated as the sum of all price adjustments
    divided by the item's quantity, instead of each price adjustment
    calculating its own unit price and adding them up. This allows the
    calculation of other discount values to be accurate if the
    BuySomeGetSome discount discounts the amount of an entire unit.

    appears in price range filters on the storefront.

    ECOMMERCE-6241
    Matt Duffy

*   Allow Spaces in Product Filter Pattern Validation

    Filters cannot have the "Type" property associated with them, so
    Workarea has a browser-based pattern validation ensuring the filter name
    is never "Type" or "type". This regular expression had the unintentional
    effect of blocking spaces in new filter names through the admin, resulting
    in some confusion. Add to the regex in order to allow it to support
    spaces before or after the word "Type" is detected (or at all).

    ECOMMERCE-6163
    Tom Scott

*   Allow Changing Taxonomy Slugs in Workflow

    Workarea now ensures that taxonomy changes occur outside the context of
    a release, in order to address a validation error that occurs when an
    admin attempts to add a new taxon in the middle of the taxonomy tree.

    Add the "Add, Remove, or Change a Custom Product Template" guide which
    replaces the "Create a Custom Product Template" guide. This expands the

    information about each step to do it manually, as well as documentation
    around changing and removing existing templates.

*   Fix Overriding SVG Icons in Style Guide

    SVG icons could not be overridden in the style guides, instead, the icon
    would just be appended to the end of the list. Update the
    `#style_guide_icons` helper to ensure only 1 of each filename exists, so
    icons will appear to override each other in the style guide.
    Additionally, instead of filtering icon paths by their "engine slug"
    (e.g. "storefront", "admin"), just use the '*' wildcard, because it made
    the whole thing impossible to test.

*   Collect All Payment Methods into ARIA Radiogroup

    The ARIA `role="radiogroup"` is meant to encapsulate all radio buttons
    on a page, and we were separating these radio buttons by saved cards and
    new cards. Set the `role` of the
    `.checkout-payment__primary-method-group` element and remove the extra
    `div` elements added to the page during the WCAG audit.

*   Fix Payment Method Selection in Checkout

    When switching between a New Credit Card and Saved Credit Card in the
    payment step of checkout, the fields for the New Credit Card were still
    being validated (and displayed) even though they were no longer selected.
    The JS code that is supposed to select all the other payment methods on
    the page and visually un-select them was only targeting siblings of the
    current payment method, which as of v3.3.1, v3.0.35, v3.1.21, and v3.2.10,
    are now wrapped in a `<div aria-role="radiogroup">`, and therefore are
    no longer siblings of the selected item. Change the way we're targeting
    the elements for selection/un-selection on the page from sibling-based
    to top-down, using the top-level `<form>` element as a "root" to find
    all other payment methods, and the `event.currentTarget` to find the
    "current" element that is being selected.

    ECOMMERCE-6224
    Tom Scott

*   Fix Redirection When Editing Content

    When editing content for a given `Contentable` model, like navigation,
    the `return_to` param was not being passed between the content block
    type chooser form and the actual content block editor form.
    Additionally, this param was not being passed on the delete action,
    causing post-action redirects from these locations to result in the
    default, which goes to the content model itself and loses track of the
    object that content is being edited for. Ensure that the `return_to`
    param is being passed to these locations so that all actions redirect
    back to the content editor form from which one came.

Workarea 3.3.6 (2018-08-21)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Handle missing Geocoder data when bogus IP is given

    In certain environments (like Docker), IP addresses are not guaranteed to
    be valid, thus a `Geocoder` response has the potential of returning
    invalid data for the `Geolocation#coordinates` method. Update this
    method to call `#compact` on the Array it returns, causing it to be
    empty in the case that an invalid IP address is geocoded.

    This guide instructs implementers of the Workarea platform on how to
    change the product placeholder image from the default provided by the
    platform, or even a theme. It also mentions how to configure the product
    placeholder filename, which by default is `product_placeholder.jpg`,
    that is used to look up a placeholder from the asset pipeline.

*   Fix product_image_url not being absolute when asset host is a proc

    Discovered on URBN, this is a bug when asset host is a proc. This
    is a situation we must handle after using one in multi site to
    provide automatic asset host management.

*   Preview Future Navigation Menu Changes

    Changes to the navigation menu order (and activity) are now visible when
    previewing a future release. To achieve this, the `#navigation_menus`
    helper sorts the collection returned from the database by its
    `#position`, which (unlike a bare DB query) is affected by the release
    changes.

*   Clean up a few minor issues in the "Testing" document

    Chris Cressman

*   Update Testing Guide for v3.3

    - Document changing configuration for the duration of a test
    - Document setting a locale for the duration of a test
    - Document time manipulation within a test using ActiveSupport's `travel_to` (thanks @fbongiovanni)
    - Note that a decorator path cannot be passed as an argument to a test runner, and provide an example for how to run tests in isolation that are located within `.decorator` files. (thanks @khenson)
    - Explain quote usage throughout the document (thanks @khenson)

*   Add unique indexes for uniqueness-validated fields

    There are a number of places, namely `Catalog::Category`,
    `Content::Email`, and `Navigation::Taxon`, that were missing unique
    indexes and thus resulted in a full table scan upon validation. In most
    cases this is inconsequential to page load times, but in larger
    deployments this scan can pose a problem when attempting to save these
    items from the admin. Therefore, we've added unique indexes to all
    fields that are validated for uniqueness out of the box, in order to
    mitigate this problem on future deployments. We still stress that fields
    that you have decorated to validate uniqueness should also have unique
    indexes associated with them in the database.

*   Autocomplete product by ID and SKUs

    This regression was introduced in v3.2.0 when we removed the product's
    ID from the `#search_text` to improve matching. That field is
    full-text analyzed, and was causing incorrect matches to occur when
    performing an admin search, but as a result of its removal, the "jump
    to" autocomplete would no longer match on product ID or SKUs. We've
    added these data points into the `#jump_to_search_text` field, which is
    *not* analyzed as fulltext, so that products can be matched by ID or
    SKUs in the jump-to autocomplete.

    ECOMMERCE-6187

*   Adjust wysiwyg to use correct method for preserving link targets.

    {{preserve}} was added in our customization of WYSIHTML5, and when the editor was updated to WYSIHTML, we did not adjust this reference. The new method that does this same thing is named {{any}}.

*   Only send refund emails for non-zero amounts

    When an order for $0.00 is refunded, we were sending a transactional
    email indicatin that the order had been refunded. The core system no
    longer does this, instead refraining to deliver the email if the refund
    amount is $0.00.

    ECOMMERCE-6196
    Tom Scott

*   Fix error on display of email content updates

    When email content updates were displayed in the activity feed, a syntax
    error was thrown due to a lack of parenthesis at the `else` end of a ternary
    statement in Haml. Once this error was resolved, however, a new error
    would be thrown stating that `Content::Email#name` was not a method.
    Define this method as the titleized version of `Content::Email#type` in
    order to view the activity feed for email content properly in admin.

*   Include selected taxon in left nav cache key

    For categories and pages, the selected child taxon for a given top-level
    node in the taxonomy was not being included in the fragment cache key
    for the left navigation, resulting in the incorrect link being bolded
    when changing subcategories from this nav. If a child taxon is selected
    in the breadcrumbs, we'll put its ID in the cache key to differentiate
    that cache from others, otherwise the key will stay the same.

*   Assign Dragonfly attributes explicitly in data file imports

    When importing catalog products with embedded image URLs, e.g. with the
    header `images_image_url`, the image could not be added because the
    attribute was not being sensed as a field on the model. We're now taking
    attributes that start with any `dragonfly_accessor` field names, e.g.
    "image", and assigning them to the model via its `#update` method.

*   Fix finite scroll when refreshing the page

    With our "finite scroll" pagination, refreshing the page caused the
    `unload` event to get fired and the current height of the window saved
    into the local state. This prevents a waypoint from being set so that
    pagination fires when you scroll past the bottom of the page. To fix
    this, we're checking whether the viewport height of the current browser
    is greater than the height of the current scroll position. If it is,
    we're setting `height: 'auto'` in order to make sure the waypoint still
    gets fired as it would if you never refresh the page.

*   Prevent order locking when changing shipping

    When the type of shipping service is changed and the form is submitted
    too quickly, an error can occur related to order locking, since the
    requests are coming in simultaneously. Implement a request queue using
    `_.debounce()` similarly to how we prevent this issue in
    **workarea-split_shipping**, and disable the form for submission until
    all requests finish.

*   Fix swatch product display when packaged

    When a 'swatches' product is packaged within a package product, it was
    previously rendering the PDP for the package product rather than the PDP
    for the underlying swatch product, because we weren't explicitly passing
    the slug of the swatch product when generating the URL to request upon
    changes to the swatches. Ensure we're always passing the `:id` as
    the `product.slug` when building hashes to pass into `url_for` for
    generating URLs.

    Content pages were still using the `image_path` syntax to render URLs to

    the URL lookup would result in an error. Changing this to `image_url`,
    which incorporates the host, allows pages to be shared on social media.

*   Fix ActiveMerchant refinement for Net::HTTP

    ActiveMerchant recently made an update to enable more detailed logging
    of HTTP requests for PCI compliance purposes (which apparently take
    effect June 30th). They did this by applying a
    [refinement](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/doc/syntax/refinements_rdoc.html)
    to `Net::HTTP` which adds a new method, `#ssl_connection`. This was throwing a
    `NoMethodError` in the Baudville build when used with our Payflow Pro integration,
    because WebMock monkey-patches `Net::HTTP#start` and doesn't ever set
    the `@socket` variable. This causes mass havoc, but can be resolved by
    checking whether `@socket` is present before trying to call methods on
    it.

    This has been [resolved
    upstream](https://github.com/activemerchant/active_merchant/pull/2874),
    so the changes as part of this ticket are only going to be active for
    the next release, after which (as long as ActiveMerchant doesn't drag
    their feet) we will just update ActiveMerchant since it should include
    the merged changes.

    We don't allow the usage of the word "type" in a filter/detail name, and
    validate this on both the client-side and the server-side. When we
    removed the `jQuery.validate` plugin in order to fully rely on browser
    native input validation, we noticed that some of the regular expressions
    used for validation were not giving us the expected result. These
    regexes have been fixed and you can now get past adding details in the
    product edit, "create product" workflow, and bulk action sequential product editor.

*   Fix releases integration tests when time zone is set

    With the new release calendar export option added in v3.3, the
    `Admin::ReleasesIntegrationTest` will fail when `config.time_zone` is
    configured, resulting in the calendar no longer generating for UTC. To
    remedy this, we're forcing UTC time zone on all these tests and
    resetting back to the original time zone after each test runs, ensuring
    that we are always testing against the same time zone, except in the one
    unit test that we assert the calendar can operate in multiple time
    zones.

*   Make OrderDataIntegrationTest Less Great Again

    This test was originally named `Storefront::OrderDataIntegreationTest`,
    and thus caused issues when it was decorated due to the file name and
    class name not matching up. Rename the class to
    `Storefront::OrderDataIntegrationTest`. While the test is ostensibly
    much less great due to this change, it does allow implementors to
    decorate its methods, thus improving its usefulness in our platform.

*   Prevent throwing an error when SVG file can't be found in Sprockets

    In the base implementation of `InlineSvg`, it would seem that locally,
    we assume that an SVG file is present in Sprockets, and if it isn't an
    error is thrown. This `NoMethodError` is very difficult to reason about
    as a developer, so we're rescuing and treating the response as if we're
    missing the SVG, leveraging the existing system in place for handling
    that error.

*   Remove jQuery Validation from the admin

    Since we live in 2018, aka The Future, the last two versions of all
    "modern browsers" support native HTML-5 form validation, and since the
    Admin only supports the last two version of all "modern browsers," we
    stand in defiant protest against the tyranny that was, is, and forever
    shall be jQuery Validation by removing it as a dependency from the Admin.

*   Fix geolocation when IP address cannot be geocoded

    When IP address cannot be geocoded, _almost_ every method in

    Several deep issues with 2.5 compatibility right now:
    * seeding fails due to an unkown bug with SwappableList
    * bizarre delegation failures in checkout step classes
    * segfaults when running tests

    For now, disallow Ruby 2.5. We will revisit this in the not-so-distant
    future.

    ECOMMERCE-5887

*   Prevent duplicate IDs when editing content blocks

    By default, the Rails form helper tags will generate an ID based on the
    `name` attribute of the element and the name of the `<form>` tag it's
    surrounded by. Because fieldsets within the same form sometimes share
    names, we used the `dom_id()` helper method to generate mostly-unique
    DOM IDs for each element. As we gradually shifted to a more asynchronous
    and feature-rich content editor, it was observed that duplicate IDs were
    appearing on the page for different fieldsets, or sometimes the same
    fieldset rendered multiple times in a content block. To prevent this,
    we're now setting `id: nil` on all tags that previously had a `dom_id`
    associated with it. This will ensure that Rails won't generate an ID on
    the DOM element, which is not necessary given the way we handle styling
    and behavior for elements on the page.

    ECOMMERCE-5873
    Tom Scott

*   Ensure releases in primary nav are unique

    When rendering release options in the primary nav, it was possible for
    the same release to make it in there twice, because the release is both
    "current" and "upcoming" as it is being edited. Ensure that the list of
    releases is unique by the BSON ID from Mongo.

    ECOMMERCE-5883
    Tom Scott

*   Remove IDs from fields on product/variant forms

    Duplicate ID warnings were being thrown in certain cases on the featured
    products forms, catalog product workflow, and variant forms. Since Rails
    will (by default) set IDs on each DOM element we are creating with its
    tag helpers, we're now passing `id: nil` so IDs are not generated at
    all.

Workarea 3.3.0.beta.1 (2018-05-21)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Check for publish date when user schedules an undo

    Since we don't validate the `publish_at` date on releases when they're
    saved, it's possible for releases that have a scheduled undo date, but
    no scheduled publish date. This results in the unpublished release
    erroneously appearing on the release calendar. We're no longer allowing
    releases like this to be saved, instead, it's only valid to save a
    release with an undo date when the release has a publish date.

    This switch is certainly breaking, but many people from different
    departments expressed strong desire for it. There were several
    consequences to this change.

    This required disabling HTTP caching in the test environment. This
    should be fine, but is a potentially breaking change. Chrome didn't have
    a way to automatically clear cache that we could get to work.

    This also introduces overrides on many Capybara methods to effectively
    make XHR browser requests blocking. We experienced a lot of random
    failures related to this. We prefer stability over the slight loss of
    performance.

    To upgrade your app or plugin:
    * Change all “trigger(‘click’)” to “click”
    * Remove calls to clear_driver_cache
    * Change your tests for sorting to drag up instead of down

    This can be helpful to more quickly reindex. Example usage:

*   Display correct image when ?sku= param is given

    We can only know which images belong to a given SKU via the `:option`
    field. When `?sku=` is the only parameter given, search through all of
    the possible detail values that match search terms facets for the given
    variant, as if they were passed in the URL. A product with the URL
    `/products/foo?sku=123&color=Red` should now show the same primary image
    as if the product was requested with `/products/foo?sku=123`.

*   Ensure sidekiq is set as the ActiveJob queue_adapter

    ActionMailer is not using sidekiq when it should. It is currently using the default ActiveJob queue adapter of async. This generally doesn't exhibit any symptoms unless you are a multi-site where it will result in no emails getting sent out as the current site doesn't get properly set. See https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/19801

*   Sprinkle Analytics Sparklines throughout Admin

    Using [AtF Spark](https://aftertheflood.co/projects/atf-spark) along
    with our own analytics tracking, we're now featuring inline analytics
    sparklines on:

    - Featured Product Selection UI for Categories
    - Remote Select UI (Select2) for Products
    - Category, Product, Discount, and Search Customization Index View UIs

    You're welcome.

*   Make the active field localized

    This allows more flexibility when setting up sites per-locale.

    There's a feature flag to turn this off if you want to avoid a MongoDB
    migration in an upgrade scenario.

*   Normalize product rules

    If a boolean category product rule is set to "TRUE" or "FALSE", they
    won't be considered as the true/false values and cause an error down the
    line. Look for normalized matches of the value to "true" and "false"
    rather than the raw value the user typed in.

*   Remove documentation URLs from generator files

    The help text and boilerplate comments for the discount and pricing
    generators includes references to specific guides. The references are
    out of date. Updating them will lead to the same problem in the future.

    Remove these references altogether, or replace them with more generic
    references.

*   Pass product detail params when SKU option changes

    When the SKU option changes on the generic template, collect product
    details together and pass them along as query parameters to simulate
    hitting that product's direct URL. This allows images to change based on
    the current SKU selection.

Workarea 3.2.6 (2018-04-03)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Convert IDs in .find_ordered to String

    If `String` IDs are passed into `Mongoid::Document.find_ordered`,
    comparisons might fail because they are not equal to the
    `BSON::ObjectId` that `Mongoid::Document#id` returns. Make sure that
    both values are converted to `String` before comparing them.

    ECOMMERCE-5011
    Tom Scott

*   Fix argument order for SETEX command

    We were previously using the wrong order here, which caused some errors
    on the Redis server. Fix the order of arguments to `Redis::Store#setex`
    (which maps to the same order of arguments as Redis' `SETEX` command).

    ECOMMERCE-5927
    Tom Scott

*   Ignore unsaved changes on initial select2 element

    A `.select2` tag will always trigger the `unsavedChanges` module on page
    load due to the way it loads data into the new element it creates.
    Prevent this from happening by adding `data-unsaved-changes-ignore` to
    the `select` tag causing the issue.

    ECOMMERCE-5219

*   Return promise with WORKAREA.currentUser.refresh

    The return values of the `gettingUserData` and `refresh` methods differ,

*   Fix incorrect display of default region data to user

    When regions in an optgroup are displayed to the user in the addresses
    step of checkout, we were mistakenly visually selecting the first region
    in the `<optgroup>` for the selected country but still keeping the value
    of the field blank. This caused an somewhat confusing validation error
    as the user didn't believe they needed to manually select the first region
    in the list for their country.

    This solution was discovered by @ddavis [in her fix for LCMAINT-861](https://stash.tools.weblinc.com/projects/NS/repos/lime-crime/pull-requests/2264/overview)
    on LimeCrime. We ported over her changes to match the new names of
    modules in v3.

*   Restore Time.now in plugin template

    When we converted remaining `Time.now` references to `Time.current`,
    this broke the plugin template because `ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone`
    isn't available quite yet. Restore this one reference back to `Time.now`
    so plugins can be generated again.

Workarea 3.2.5 (2018-03-20)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Scroll test browser to bottom of the page in pagination tests

    The pagination system tests have the ability to fail due to the
    configuration of the grid on either categories#show or searches#show.
    Scrolling the browser to the bottom of the test should ensure that, no
    matter the configuration, the waypoints controlling the pagination
    functionality will still operate as expected.

*   Resore browser-default focus styling

    In v2.x we applied a custom focus-ring to all focusable elements. In
    v3.x we abandoned this approach and offered a focus-ring only to custom
    UIs. Some cruft was left over, resulting in browser-default focus styling
    to be removed erroneously.

    ECOMMERCE-5872
    Curt Howard

*   Handle malformed facet param

    If a filter is specified in the URL as a String rather than an Array
    (`?color=Maroon` for example), combining more filter values for the same
    filter results in the values getting concatenated rather than specified
    as multiple elements of an Array. Ensure that we're always dealing with
    an Array before calling `<<` to shovel in new values to the param so
    that links on the filter sidebar combine more values rather than
    concatenate a single one.

*   Replace Time.now calls with Time.current

    There were a few more instances of `Time.now` being used, replaced these

*   Fix help articles route in the activity feed

    When help articles are edited or created, a 500 error occurred on the
    admin homepage because we were calling the non-existant route helper
    method `help_articles_path`. This has been replaced by the route
    helper's real name, `help_path`, and prevents errors on admin homepage
    after saving or updating help articles.

*   Fix dialog display on iOS Safari

    On some devices, with MobileSafari only, dialogs that take up the whole
    page (such as "Add An Address") will appear midway down in the viewport,
    not at the top where it is expected. Add some CSS to properly position
    the element.

*   Support custom anchors in style guide links

    When we moved modifier style guides inside their parent blocks, we
    didn't update the `link_to_style_guide` helper for generating these
    links, breaking links and causing some style guides to effectively not
    be navigable.

*   Truncate :return_to cookie to prevent overflow

    We experienced an `ActionDispatch::Cookies::CookieOverflowError` when
    attempting to add a `:return_to` URL that had more than 4096 bytes in
    it. To remedy this, we're trimming query parameters off the full URL if
    `like_text` is present anywhere in the String.

    ECOMMERCE-5387
    Tom Scott

*   Fix recommendations tests related to order expiration period.

    Because of our use of `3.months` in the order expiration period instead
    of `90.days` (which is easier to add `1.day` to), a few
    recommendations-related tests failed on February 28th, 2018, and
    probably will fail in future years.

*   Only set default admin permissions when user becomes admin

    Previously, these permissions were defaulting to `true`, and it looked
    odd on the front-end to have users who were clearly not admins have
    "permission to publish releases". This resolves that by only setting the
    defaults for `can_publish_now` and `can_restore` when a user becomes an
    admin.

    Ben Crouse

*   Fix typecasting in boolean content fields

    When a boolean content field is saved once into the database, then
    its data is re-validated, the `Content::Fields::Boolean` class would
    accidentally typecast a Boolean value that already exists. Since `false
    != 'false'`, the type is always casted to `true`, rather than `false`.
    We're now ensuring the argument passed into
    `Content::Fields::Boolean#typecast` is actually a String before
    comparing it as such.

    ECOMMERCE-5722

*   Remove test for multiple assignment of tokens. ECOMMERCE-5073

    Tom Scott

*   URL-safe reading from document.cookie

    When `document.cookie` is parsed with the `WORKAREA.cookie.read()`
    function, we are failing to account for values which may have an "=" in
    them, resulting in truncated values of the cookie when read out. After
    splitting the cookie by ";" and then by "=", we're now reconstructing
    the value of the cookie if it contains any "=" characters by hand,
    which fixes an issue when using **workarea-compare** with v3.

    ECOMMERCE-4763

*   Dasherize content block name class modifier for BEM compliant classes

    ECOMMERCE-5730
    Jake Beresford

*   Ensure sidekiq is set as the ActiveJob queue_adapter

    ActionMailer is not using sidekiq when it should. It is currently using the default ActiveJob queue adapter of async. This generally doesn't exhibit any symptoms unless you are a multi-site where it will result in no emails getting sent out as the current site doesn't get properly set. See https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/19801

*   Fix plugin :changelog task to work when no tags exist

    When there are no tags on the current repo, the :changelog task

*   Don't check password expiry when changing password

    This prevents a possible "loop" condition where an expired admin
    password cannot be changed to a new one, resulting in the admin no
    longer being able to log in. Refrain from checking password expiry on
    actions that are used in the periodic password reset workflow.

*   Add new action for viewing product details

    Rather than overloading the `workarea/storefront/products#show` action
    on XHR requests, an entirely separate action that can only be accessed
    with XHR is created for viewing just the product details of a specified
    SKU. This is technically an improvement, but fixes long-standing issues
    in a few separate plugins related to overriding
    `ProductsController#show` on XHR requests.

Workarea 3.2.1 (2018-02-06)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Enforce one authenticity_token input per form

    It's possible that multiple `authenticity_token` inputs were being added
    to the same `<form>` by the `WORKAREA.authenticityToken` module, because
    we were never checking whether an input existed for the CSRF token.
    We're now ensuring that an input tag doesn't already exist, and if it
    does, we're updating that input tag's value with that of the user's CSRF
    token from `/current_user.json`, in case it's cached for some reason.

    ECOMMERCE-5686
    Tom Scott

*   Validate :name instead of :field on product rules

    Product rules, originally called category rules, originally called the
    name of the attribute that we're filtering on a "field", but in v3.x
    that got changed to "name". Due to validations not getting updated,
    however, we were still validating on the `#field` method, which is
    defined further down and will always be present. We're now validating
    that the product rule has a name again.

    ECOMMERCE-5220
    Tom Scott

*   Query for products with variants when seeding discounts

    Prevents a race condition whereby a product with no SKUs can be
    retrieved, causing a validation error in seeding. We're now always
    looking for products that have at least one variant, and assuming the
    variant has a SKU since it's a validated field of
    `Workarea::Catalog::Variant`.

    ECOMMERCE-5684
    Tom Scott

*   Fix error when using Redis gem v4.x

    When `Workarea::AutoexpireCacheRedis` is called and v4.0 of the Redis
    gem is installed, an error will occur because the `Redis#[]` and
    `Redis#[]=` methods are no longer available. To remedy this, we're now
    using the more canonical `Redis#get` and `Redis#setex` to get the values
    of keys from the Redis server and to set key/value pairs on Redis with
    an attached TTL value.

    ECOMMERCE-5685

*   Correct return value of ImageOptimProcessor

    Originally, the `ImageOptimProcessor` returned either the optimized
    image or the original image if it couldn't be optimized, but not
    actually updating the image record in place with its new attributes.
    We're now running the `#update` method on the document passed into
    `ImageOptimProcessor` so that it doesn't need to be optimized on each
    request.

    name of the attribute that we're filtering on a "field", but in v3.x
    that got changed to "name". Due to validations not getting updated,
    however, we were still validating on the `#field` method, which is
    defined further down and will always be present. We're now validating
    that the product rule has a name again.

*   Query for products with variants when seeding discounts

    Prevents a race condition whereby a product with no SKUs can be
    retrieved, causing a validation error in seeding. We're now always
    looking for products that have at least one variant, and assuming the
    variant has a SKU since it's a validated field of
    `Workarea::Catalog::Variant`.

*   Fix error when using Redis gem v4.x

    When `Workarea::AutoexpireCacheRedis` is called and v4.0 of the Redis
    gem is installed, an error will occur because the `Redis#[]` and
    `Redis#[]=` methods are no longer available. To remedy this, we're now
    using the more canonical `Redis#get` and `Redis#setex` to get the values
    of keys from the Redis server and to set key/value pairs on Redis with
    an attached TTL value.

    ECOMMERCE-5685

    Dave Barnow

*   Configure new apps to run on Workarea Hosting out of the box

    When generating a new application it is now configured out of the box
    with proper `qa`, `staging`, and `production` settings for
    Workarea Hosting environments.

    ECOMMERCE-5654

*   Fix double Dragonfly configuration issue

    Prevents `Workarea::Configuration::Dragonfly.load` configuration
    from being clobbered.

    ECOMMERCE-5656
    Thomas Vendetta

*   Correct return value of ImageOptimProcessor

    Originally, the `ImageOptimProcessor` returned either the optimized
    image or the original image if it couldn't be optimized, but not
    actually updating the image record in place with its new attributes.
    We're now running the `#update` method on the document passed into
    `ImageOptimProcessor` so that it doesn't need to be optimized on each
    request.

    ECOMMERCE-5653
    Tom Scott

*   Use proper class name for select addresses dropdown

    ECOMMERCE-5644
    Dave Barnow

*   Ability to initialize application without external services

    When the environment variable `WORKAREA_SKIP_SERVICES` is present,
    Mongoid and Redis will not be configured on application boot.

    ECOMMERCE-5648
    Thomas Vendetta

*   Ensure form controls receive the proper classes on submit

    This fixes an issue where the `--invalid` classes weren't being
    applied properly to invalid form controls on submit.

*   Reduce chance of desceptive performance test failures

    Scenarios arise where a performance test runs faster than average,
    causing future tests to compare to the anomaly and fail incorrectly.
    To minimize the chance of this happening, performance tests will drop
    the highest and lowest measurements from previous runs before comparing
    results.
    Matt Duffy

*   Add append point on products#show between description and recommendations

    Matt Duffy

*   Update password requirements for admins

    Per the PCI audit, we need to ensure that admin users are using passwords that
    contain both alpha and numeric values and at least 7 characters long.

Workarea 3.2.0.beta.4 (2018-01-25)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Release version 3.2.0.beta.4

    Curt Howard

*   Override content block type fieldset name

    The name of a fieldset is used as a unique identifier, and we always
    attempt to find an existing fieldset to append to rather than create a
    new one. In some cases, however, a fieldset name must be changed but
    most of its internals need to be preserved. For that, we have a new
    keyword argument on the fieldset method: `replaces:`, which takes a
    String equal to the ID in which its replacing.

*   Fix admin recent searches XSS vulnerability

    In the admin recent searches dashboard widget, we were previously using
    jQuery's `.html()` method to add recent query strings to the page. This
    had the unintended consequence of evaluating each string as HTML, which
    permits cross-site scripting attacks to occur from the storefront to
    admin users of the application. We're now using jQuery's `text()`
    method, which escapes HTML by way of setting the element's `innerText`
    rather than its `innerHTML`.

*   No need to specify fallbacks to fix I18n JS bloat

    The various ways to define fallbacks mean choosing one ahead of time can

    Featured product changes are not reflected in release previewing. Adding
    messaging on the admin pages ensures users are aware of this limitation.

    ECOMMERCE-5175
    Matt Duffy

*   Disable sending email in unit tests

    Because emails use Elasticsearch for recommendations, sending emails during unit
    tests causes unreliability in builds. Since we're almost never asserting against
    email in them, disable emails in unit tests by default.

*   Update development environment guide

    * Note the incompatibility of MongoDB 3.6
    * Suggest Node.js as a JavaScript runtime
    * Update the minimum Ruby version for Workarea 3.2
    * Suggest keeping Bundler up to date

    ECOMMERCE-5604
    Chris Cressman

*   Fix I18n translation JS bloat

    Production JS files can be huge to due lots of unused locale translations being
    included. the fix is to specify your locales in Rails config, then only those
    will be used in rendering the JS translations.

    In base, we can fix this by specifying a default locale (en) before
    configuration, ensuring that even if an app doesn't specify a locale we'll
    always have a default.

    personal CSRF param and token to be used for any form submissions that

    using expired or invalid authenticity tokens due to `Rack::Cache`
    caching older tokens from past requests.

*   Give form controls a clear disabled state

    In the admin, when a form control was disabled, it didn't actually look
    disabled. In the storefront the form control was bizarrely 50% opacity.

    This commit also styles readonly elements the same as disabled elements.

    ECOMMERCE-5255
    Curt Howard

*   Add email address to Order Confirmation page

    Per Baymard.com:

    On the confirmation page, the wording of the text that alerts users to the fact that a confirmation email has been sent is especially important. This text should include the email address to which the confirmation email was sent, to provide users the opportunity to verify that it’s the correct email address. This is useful not just for those users who may have a typo in their order email, but also to prevent impatient users from worrying if they might have made a typo. Similarly, users who have completed the checkout using a previously created account, may now use a different email address than the one originally tied to the account – as it occurred during testing.

    ECOMMERCE-5042

*   Validate phone number formatting on Storefront

    ECOMMERCE-4965

*   Add a text-box--full modifier

    Curt Howard

*   Fix .value__error alignment when inside grid

    Since `.value__error` is typically injected via jQuery Validation, if
    the form field validated is within a grid, there was a good chance that
    the injected error will break layout.
    Curt Howard

*   Clean up todos

    * Remove Admin::OrderViewModel#status which would fall back to fullfillment
    status. These are now explicitly two separate statuses.
    * Move catalog product bulk action options to a helper method to clean up
    view and allow for easier addition of options
    * Update Fulfillment.find_statuses to clarify intent of logic
    * Fix grammar on todo

Workarea 3.2.0.beta.1 (2018-01-15)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Release version 3.2.0.beta.1

    Curt Howard

*   Revert "Add CSRF param/token to current_user.json"

    This reverts commit 86de76b4c93c0510099d97786b1d5e505ac03c3c.

*   Add CSRF param/token to current_user.json

    When user information is requested from the server, include their
    personal CSRF param and token to be used for any form submissions that
    occur on cached pages, such as the PDP with one-click checkout. Avoids
    using expired or invalid authenticity tokens due to `Rack::Cache`
    caching older tokens from past requests.

    ECOMMERCE-5583
    Tom Scott

*   Set autocomplete="off" on all storefront password fields

    By default, browsers can save the information typed into form fields
    that have `autocomplete="on"`, which is default for password fields.
    We don't ever want password data to be saved unexpectedly on users'
    machines, so in order to retain PCI compliance we're applying
    `autocomplete="off"` to each password field on the storefront. The
    Alertlogic web application firewall does this as well as a fallback,
    therefore Workarea customers on past versions will not need to manually
    make this change.

    ECOMMERCE-5590
    Tom Scott

    ECOMMERCE-5487
    Chris Cressman

*   Explicitly require countries mongoid extension

    The countries/global file is required, and tests whether `Mongoid` is
    defined prior to inserting its extensions allowing direct persistence
    of a `Country` object. This can cause an issue if, for some reason, the
    countries gem is required *before* Mongoid, in which case this extension
    will not be loaded, because Ruby's `require` does not attempt to load
    something a second time if it knows the filepath has already been
    required. The result of this is that the country field is not
    serialized out of a String if that was the type that it was sent in as
    (e.g., a v2.x project's data). To remedy this issue, we're now
    explicitly requiring `countries/mongoid` in core, so that the mongoid
    extension is always available if you `require 'workarea/core'` in your
    project.

    ECOMMERCE-5582

    Reporting of performance tests is currently output before the failure
    of an assertion is recorded, leaving all runs reporting as passed.

    ECOMMERCE-5589
    Matt Duffy

*   Add placed_at to admin search index

    Queries run on a fresh admin index that has no orders can throw errors

    Chris Cressman

*   Improve copied product ID UX in first step of flow

    The system-default copied product ID was causing strange behavior in
    the recommendations functionality, since both the product ID and copied
    ID were so similar.

    The flow has been reworked to not be assumptive. A user is prompted to
    choose a new ID. Additionally, two buttons are offered. One to copy the
    original (restoring the previous behavior) and one to totally randomize
    the product ID.

    Carts were being cleared when checkout was entered, presumably because
    they get saved so we can begin saving data on the `Order`. Attempt to
    find the most recent previous order that has not been abandoned in
    `Order.find_current` to return back to the expected behavior.

*   Fix graph data not displaying

    In Rails 5.1, `#to_json` was not HTML-safe by default, and so would
    escape characters like quotes, causing the graphs for products,
    categories, and search customizations insights to not display. We're now
    attaching `#html_safe` to the end of all `to_json` method calls so that
    the data contained within renders properly.

    This UI didn't fit well with the overall branding of the Admin and was
    something that was slated for a refactor during the initial v3
    development.

    The reworking of this UI now offers user a very bold and eye-catching
    interface that fits much more closely with the vision upheld throughout
    the Admin's design.

*   Rely on ajax for all release menu UI operations

    After noticing an issue in PhanomJS regarding the submission of a
    hidden form and the resulting need for an exceptional timeout in
    order to get the tests to pass, the `WORKAREA.publishWithReleaseMenus`
    module has been rewritten to _only_ use AJAX requests.

    This gives us a more predictable experience and allows us to use
    wait_for_xhr in the proper way inside the system tests.

    A number of system tests corresponding to releases needed to be
    rewritten for revalidation purposes after this change.

*   Allow releases to be created asynchronously

    Now, while editing a releasable object, a user can create a new
    release immediately before saving their work. This is handled
    asynchronously so that a user would not lose their progress when
    creating and switching to their new release.

    This work does not affect the release menu UI in the top-left of
    the Admin, as that UI's intended purpose is to contextually change
    the release that you are currently editing.

    ECOMMERCE-5202

*   Use tables on Admin indexes

    There was a lot of negative feedback around the summary-based display
    used on the index views throughout the Admin when v3.0 launched.

    This commit uses a table-based UI, instead of the summary-based UI,
    on said index views.

    For mixed results, such as search and releasable objects, the summary-
    based UI is retained.

*   Standardize use of general Rails timezone config

    Establish use of standard guidelines from this post:
    https://robots.thoughtbot.com/its-about-time-zones

    We can dramatically simplify timezone code in the admin for this, but to
    prevent breaking in upgrades we'll want to wait for v4 (or meter it out
    slowly over the next few minor releases). I think this is enough
    breaking changes for one release.

    * Switch mapping to allow full word tokens for correction
    * Switch to phrase suggest for more contextual suggestions
    * Filter out suggestions from inactive products

    A reindex of storefront would be required to get the most out of these
    changes, but it should continue to function without erroring otherwise.

    Ben Crouse

*   Improve exact matching and redirecting in search

    Redirect to a product if it's an exact match on ID, SKU, or name.
    Otherwise, render search results as normal. This should clear up some of
    the confusion around the previous product redirect functionality.

    The implementation uses a trick with scoring to avoid having to do extra
    queries (either in MongoDB or Elasticsearch).

    To get the full effect, you'll want to reindex but if you choose not to
    reindex the site will continue to function normally.

Workarea 3.1.8 (2018-01-09)

*   Fix credit card validation console error

    Since jQuery Validation was upgraded in v3.0.0 we've been missing true
    front-end validation on credit card fields. The
    `jquery-validation-rails` gem has compartmentalized these additional
    validations into its own file, which is now included in the Storefront
    by default.

    This commit also removes the broken and problematic `pattern` attribute in
    `postal_code` fields.

*   Use fully-qualfied canonical URLs

    When providing URLs for `<link rel="canonical">` tags, we're not
    including the full domain and protocol, and that causes issues during
    SEO audits. Make sure that all canonical tags use the `_url` path
    helpers, and 'https' as the protocol.

    ECOMMERCE-5484
    Tom Scott

*   Fix logout problems in Safari

    Safari will pre-fetch "paused" (cached) pages and start running JS ahead
    of time as the page "unpasuses". This running JS ahead of time causes a
    request to current_user.json, which sets the auth cookie. A race
    condition then starts between the logout request and the current_user
    request which sometimes leaves the auth cookie after logging out.

    The solution is to switch this to a DELETE method which it probably
    should have been the whole time, since this request isn't idempotent.

    ECOMMERCE-5476
    Ben Crouse

*   Extend dependent selector of WORKAREA.checkoutShippingServices

    With the release of v3.2 some plugins should be making use of the base

*   Whitelist benign HTML attributes

    Tag attributes like `style`, `href`, and `alt` might actually be added by

    wysihtml. Add the previously mentioned attributes to the whitelist so
    that wysihtml will display content properly.

    ECOMMERCE-5532
    Ben Crouse

*   Define self-assignment methods for SwappableList

    Calling `SwappableList#+=` previously returned an `Array`, causing the
    value to possibly become mutated in place using Ruby's `+=` syntax
    sugar. SwappableList now defines the `#+` and `#-` methods so that any
    mutation in place using `+=` and `-=` will no longer change the type of
    `Workarea.config.seeds`.

    ECOMMERCE-5531
    Tom Scott

*   Change VCR Cassette Persister to handle nested cassettes

    When creating a new cassette if there's a folder in the use_cassette

    directories for the current cassette.

    ECOMMERCE-5528

*   Use Workarea.config when duplicating for temporary modification in .with_config

    Plugins like multi-site can modify the value of `Workarea.config`. To ensure
    consistent behavior, that method is now used when copying the configuration
    temporarily rather than looking to the original source of
    `Workarea::Configuration.config` which may not always be the current version
    of the configuration.

*   Fix address regions UI

    Due to "a difference of opinion" (let's say) between Safari, IE, and the
    rest of the sane web development world a significant change was required
    to the way we were conditionally displaying regions for a chosen
    country.

    Whereas before we were simply `display: none`ing the child `optgroup`s
    underneath the region select, we now must completely remove them and
    replace them with only the matching `optgroup`. This is because Safari
    and IE disallow styles being applied to form elements in this manner.

Workarea 3.1.7 (2017-12-12)

*   Escape help page markdown HTML

    The Markdown body of help pages is marked as a safe string for Rails,
    but any raw HTML code within that Markdown is not going to be. We need
    to mark the entire result string as HTML-safe so that when it is
    rendered, we are seeing actual formatting rather than HTML tags.

    ECOMMERCE-5481
    Tom Scott

*   Update redis-rack-cache to v2.0.2

    Unlike redis-rails, redis-rack-cache had a bad dependency in its gemspec
    that forced redis-store to be locked in at 1.3.0, which at that version
    can allow for remote code execution in very specific circumstances.
    Although we're not affected due to the way we deploy our applications,
    this patch is still necessary in order to appease security audits in the
    future.

    ECOMMERCE-5513
    Tom Scott

*   Fix boosts for products with no views scores

    In the "field_value_factor" part of the "function_score" we are using the
    modifier log1p. When the views_score is 0, log(1) = 0, and the boosts
    essentially get nullified resulting in all returned documents (with views_score
    of 0) having the same score.

    Changing the modifier to "log2p" or ensures the minimum value isn't 0, so boosts
    multiplication still has an effect.

*   Fix category product rule field duplication

    The usage of turbolinks causes unnecessary inputs to be rendered on the
    screen even though select2 has already rendered them. This is because
    our `initModules` function was typically called once, maybe twice per
    run, but is now being called indefinitely since each `turbolinks:load`
    event must reinitialize all modules (since we could be dealing with very
    different markup). We're now binding to the `turbolinks:load` event in
    the remoteSelects module, as well as initializing select2 on any
    elements that it doesn't already have binding to. This is so we don't
    accidentally re-init the same element, but we also initialize any new
    select2 elements on the page.

    ECOMMERCE-5332
    Tom Scott

*   Fix generic template first option selection

    Users were reporting that the first `<option>` in the generic template
    could not be selected in any environment which has caching enabled. This
    is because the cache key of the product without any option selected was
    incorrect, we were choosing the first variant's SKU as the "current_sku"
    in `Storefront::ProductViewModel::CacheKey`, and since option selection
    now updates the entire HTML of the generic template, it looked like the
    JS was having trouble selecting the proper `<option>` tag for the page,
    but in reality it was because the wrong SKU was set on the view model.

*   Fix inline SVGs not appearing in production

    Configure a new asset finder for SVGs that inherits from the

*   Fix exception thrown on bulk editing with an empty selection

    Instead of a failed validation, the user would see an exception being
    thrown when a selection of 0 items was made during bulk editing. Rather
    than show this ugly error, we now have a validation condition requiring
    some IDs to be selected and are permitting explicit parameters related
    to the bulk action in the `create` action.

*   Fix graph data not displaying

    In Rails 5.1, `#to_json` was not HTML-safe by default, and so would
    escape characters like quotes, causing the graphs for products,
    categories, and search customizations insights to not display. We're now
    attaching `#html_safe` to the end of all `to_json` method calls so that
    the data contained within renders properly.

*   Select the current region scoped within the current country's optgroup

    When two countries are available that have regions using the same
    2-digit codes (such as "Pennsylvania" from USA and "Palauli" from
    American Samoa), it's possible for the browser to not be able to
    differentiate between both `<option>` tags. The JS for selecting the
    proper region has been modified to *always* be scoped under the
    `<optgroup>` that represents the country, otherwise we can accidentally
    select the wrong `<option>` from another country's `<optgroup>`.

    When selecting multiple categories in a product rule for "Category
    equals", all rules are combined together and only show products matching
    every rule. We needed searches to return results that match any of the
    category rules, not all of them, so we're wrapping the combined category rules
    query in a "should" (which is the way Elasticsearch spells "OR") clause.
    Multiple categories can be specified by separating their IDs with commas.

    It's possible for `Catalog::Product.find_by_sku` to return a product you

    Instead of attempting a query when the SKU passed in is `nil`, we are

*   Fix error in divider content blocks for upgrades

    Migrating from v3.0 to v3.1 will throw an error due to the divider
    content block adding new fields to the database. This fix determines
    if the fields are set or not before trying to render the template.

    This is not an issue for projects that run migrations after the
    upgrade is complete. Nor is it an issue for projects beginning
    development on v3.1.0 or higher.

*   Rewrite takeover management test in content_blocks_spec.js

    PhantomJS is a real fickle mistress. Previously we had been testing
    the functionality of the removal of the takeover on iframe load, which
    is one of the two usecases for the removal. PhantomJS, in Bamboo, just
    started randomly failing this test, probably because of the way we
    we were forced to construct the test iframe in the first place.

    This test has been rewritten to support the other type of management,
    the defacto time-based removal, which previously had been untested.

*   Add dragonfly-s3_data_store to app template

    In most deployment setups, S3 is used as a data store for Dragonfly.
    While this is not a requirement of the platform (and therefore does not
    qualify it for a Workarea dependency), we are adding it to Gemfile as a
    "suggested" dependency to make it easier for developers to configure
    their real-world deployed applications.

*   Fix duplicate $scope initialization for PDP sku selects

    When changing skus on a generic PDP template, the new product details partial is requested via AJAX. It then replaces the existing partial in the DOM with the response form the server. The method of DOM replacement was throwing an error when attempting to reinit modules on the new DOM. The DOM replacement method has been changed to correct this.

    IT reported some Production apps were depending on Active Record because
    the person who created them did not include the option to skip Active

    Discovered in Harriet Carter, where it manifested as 404s without the
    proper host redirection kicking in.

    When a request is made to the app that doesn't have the right host, the
    enforce host kicks in too late to have effect. This updates the logic to
    enforce hosts to middleware so that can kick in regardless of Rails'
    routing.

    Although server-side everything else is in UTC, to align with admin

    In a future version, we'll want to consolidate timezone management to a
    single config option (probably relying on the Rails config) so this is a
    temporary fix.

*   Change logo from SVG to PNG

    Open Graph tags do no support SVG formatted images. There were a few possible ways to solve this:

    1. Add an additional png formatted image for use within the Open Graph tags, while keeping the main logo an svg
    2. Converting the main svg logo to a png when used within the Open Graph tag
    3. Convert the svg logo with a png format in all instances

    __Option 1__ creates an issue for implementers to know/remember to update multiple logo images. Otherwise, in their
    social shares, the Workarea logo would be shown instead of the brand.

    __Option 2__ has a few technical challenges. Since the logo does not exist in Dragonfly, but just sits in the asset pipeline,
    solutions to these challenges do not justify the effort.

    __Option 3__ was the simplest, most effective way to solve the issue. There wasn't much gained for SIs by having the logo
    be svg format in base, as svg is not always the best format for an image. So every implementation already naturally addresses
    the choice of logo format based on their needs.

*   Properly disable Feature.js tests in test environment

    Due to a race condition, the previous way we were removing the
    Feature.js classes from the root HTML element was not working
    consistently. This was due to a straight port over from the way
    we handled it for Modernizr.

    To avoid this we have rearranged the load order of the scripts
    called in Storefront's `head.js.erb` manifest. Now we load the
    Feature.js library, then the spec helper, then the Feature.js
    method which applies the classes.

    The spec helpers job is still to disable these tests and, due to
    the reorganization, this now works properly and consistently.

Workarea 3.0.15 (2017-09-26)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Tweak search suggestion logic to improve spelling corrections

    ECOMMERCE-5182
    Matt Duffy

*   Delete eslintingore, add test methods to eslintrc

    A few points:
    - `.eslintignore` didn't work on unix systems, only BSD
    - the tests were being ignored out of convenience, which was the wrong
    call. Tests are every bit as important to lint as their module
    counterparts.
    - Teaspoon fails completely silently when a syntax error is encountered,
    which is the strongest reason to use linting on these files.

    This commit also
    - Fixes url_spec.js test that was failing, silently.

    ECOMMERCE-5206
    Curt Howard

*   Fix analytics timezones

    Although server-side everything else is in UTC, to align with admin
    expectations, we'll need to configure a timezone for the time series
    data. This should be set to whatever the retailer requests.

    In a future version, we'll want to consolidate timezone management to a
    single config option (probably relying on the Rails config) so this is a
    temporary fix.

    ECOMMERCE-5132
    Matt Martyn

*   Change logo from SVG to PNG

    Open Graph tags do no support SVG formatted images. There were a few possible ways to solve this:

    1. Add an additional png formatted image for use within the Open Graph tags, while keeping the main logo an svg
    2. Converting the main svg logo to a png when used within the Open Graph tag
    3. Convert the svg logo with a png format in all instances

    __Option 1__ creates an issue for implementers to know/remember to update multiple logo images. Otherwise, in their
    social shares, the Workarea logo would be shown instead of the brand.

    __Option 2__ has a few technical challenges. Since the logo does not exist in Dragonfly, but just sits in the asset pipeline,
    solutions to these challenges do not justify the effort.

    __Option 3__ was the simplest, most effective way to solve the issue. There wasn't much gained for SIs by having the logo
    be svg format in base, as svg is not always the best format for an image. So every implementation already naturally addresses
    the choice of logo format based on their needs.

*   Remove rendering of unwanted style guide partials

    Both admin and storefront render the partials respective to their
    engine by default; however, if a host app overrides any one of these
    files, they will be erroneously rendered outside of their engines scope
    (i.e storefront styleguide partials overridden or newly created in the
    host app will ALWAYS be rendered in `/admin/style_guides`)

    These changes pass a new parameter `@scope` which is infered from the
    controller's parent.  This way. partials present in the host app will
    only be rendered as they relate to the current scope.

*   Disable http cache for admin users

    A max-age of 15 minutes was being set for the Cache-Control headers
    for admin users. This caused issues in dev environments where a page

    upstream server caches from caching as well, for admin users.

    When canceling fulfillment for items, the correct order item ID wasn't being

    In our reset css file, we were previously removing border radius for all form inputs except for the radio button. This change removes the specificity to the radio input.

Workarea 3.0.7 (2017-06-20)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Fix validation styling in Storefront

    ECOMMERCE-4706
    Curt Howard

*   Move WORKAREA.forms from Core to Storefront and Admin

    ECOMMERCE-4706
    Curt Howard

*   Fix front-end validation message styling in Storefront

    During the v3 upgrade the need for a `.value` component in the Admin was
    reduced to the point of removal. This work was not performed in the
    Storefront.

    jQuery Validate applies a class to validation messages for styling
    purposes. The `WORKAREA.forms` module initializes jQuery Validate on all
    forms. The module and it's configuration lived in the Core engine and
    applied one class to both the Admin and Storefront engines.

    Since the Admin was expecting this class to be `.property__note--error`
    and the Storefront was expecting this class to be `.value__error` the
    configuration needed to be engine-specific. This change moves
    `WORKAREA.config.forms` object from the `core/config.js` file into
    `admin/config.js` and `storefront/config.js`, which allows each engine
    to customize it's properties as needed.

    ECOMMERCE-4811
    Dave Barnow

*   Store relative URLs for product images in Elasticsearch cache

    The absolute values we have now require reindexing when moving data
    between environments. This will make transitions to production easier.

    ECOMMERCE-4783
    Ben Crouse

*   Add caching for default category of a product

    This has been a performance problem for launches.

    ECOMMERCE-4781
    Ben Crouse

*   Improve performance when indexing products based on category changes

    Take performance improvements made by Matt Martyn in a data import.

    ECOMMERCE-4824
    Ben Crouse

*   Update unique option for workers to :until_executing

    Matt Martyn discovered situations in import where the previous option
    was causing certain jobs to not be enqueued. So I'm loosening the
    uniqueness here to fix (which was his fix as well).

    ECOMMERCE-4780
    Ben Crouse

*   Fix incorrect taxes with multiple tax codes and discounts

    Taxable share only works if the price adjustment set only contains
    adjustments for the same line item.  If the order has multiple tax codes
    and a discount applied the amount for a taxable adjustment was
    incorrect.

    ECOMMERCE-4819

Workarea 3.0.6 (2017-06-07)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Handle region name properly for addresses with regionless countries

    ECOMMERCE-4748
    Matt Duffy

*   Fix asynchronous adding to cart

    On a detail page, adding something to your cart can disappear under the
    following situation:
    * no current order
    * switch SKU, XHR request for new details starts
    * click add to cart, XHR request to add starts
    * add to cart XHR returns with new cookie with order_id
    * first XHR request for new details returns with old cookie w/o order_id
    * current_order disappears

    Although we will never be able to guarantee a solution to this, these
    changes should help mitigate:
    * disable session on HTTP caching pages (we don't want session touched
      during these requests anyways)
    * disable inputs/buttons when SKU is changed
    * show loading indictor waiting for the product details request to
      return

    ECOMMERCE-4678

    ECOMMERCE-4664
    Matt Duffy

*   Fix saved addresses functionality

    When choosing a saved address for a user's shipping or billing address
    the Country & Region selects were not being set properly.

    This commit also removes the requirement from the hidden region field,
    since that field is now only shown under the very specific use-case;
    where a user selects a regionless country.

    ECOMMERCE-4761
    Curt Howard

*   Fix same day queries in the admin

    Somewhat API-breaking, but none of the v3.x builds have touched these
    files, so it seems safe to do in a patch.

    ECOMMERCE-4422
    Ben Crouse

*   Fix Workarea.with_config in system tests

    Curt Howard

*   Fix fulfillment event display and clean up fulfillment API

    This is slightly breaking, but without these changes fulfillment
    quantities will show incorrectly when different kinds of events happen
    on the same item.

    ECOMMERCE-4758
    Ben Crouse

*   Require test/support files from plugins

    Allows plugins to customize/decorate test setup when tests are run in
    host apps.

    ECOMMERCE-4762
    Ben Crouse

*   Properly disable Feature.js tests in test environment

    Due to a race condition, the previous way we were removing the
    Feature.js classes from the root HTML element was not working
    consistently. This was due to a straight port over from the way
    we handled it for Modernizr.

    To avoid this we have rearranged the load order of the scripts
    called in Storefront's `head.js.erb` manifest. Now we load the
    Feature.js library, then the spec helper, then the Feature.js
    method which applies the classes.

    The spec helpers job is still to disable these tests and, due to
    the reorganization, this now works properly and consistently.

    ECOMMERCE-4760
    Curt Howard

*   Prevent feature.js from detecting test driver as a touch device

    This will disable the touch feature and prevent the class from being added to the DOM when running tests
    ECOMMERCE-4760
    Dave Barnow

*   Remove rule fields from discount template

    The properties template generated html for fields not on a
    generated discount. Removing them prevents errors being thrown

    ECOMMERCE-4702
    Curt Howard

*   Fix Image Group content blocks

    The initial implementation of the Image Group was meant to reflow as
    users removed images from the series, always centering the last image if
    the count was odd. At some point this stopped working as intended.

    This commit simplifies the implementation in order to achieve the
    desired result.

    ECOMMERCE-4733
    Curt Howard

*   Don't render activity headers for blank pages

    A little bit of a hack to improve display of activity timeline to not
    show a day header if there are no displyable entries for that day.

    ECOMMERCE-4555
    Ben Crouse

*   Fix user activity updates not updating timestamps

    This causes 304 responses with stale data for recent views requests.

    ECOMMERCE-4484
    Ben Crouse

*   Update discount generator to use append point

    An append point was added during the select type of creating a discount
    so there is no need for a custom discount to fully overwrite the view.
    Update the generator to create a partial and add it to the append point.

*   Fix CSS selectors for image-based content blocks

    `.image-content-block` and `.image-and-text-content-block` both had link
    elements that wrapped their images. The classes were changed in
    ECOMMERCE-4673 but the CSS files were not updated.

    ECOMMERCE-4704

*   Fix file extension for taxonomy content blocks

    One, two, and three column content block partials now properly contain
    `.html` as part of their file extension chain.

    ECOMMERCE-4742
    Curt Howard

*   Remove heading elements from content blocks

    Enforcing an actual `%h2` element in the view can disrupt the flow of
    the document in addition to forcing an SI to override both the component
    and the view in order to make changes.

    - Stub out missing elements from `category-summary-content-block`
    component.

    ECOMMERCE-4741
    Curt Howard

*   Fix pages displayed in the wrong order

    Sometimes, the pagination test fails due to changes in timing of AJAX
    calls for responses. Don't use the promise's .done method because
    there's no guarantee they will be run in order.

    ECOMMERCE-4739

*   Remove the grid component from taxonomy-content-blocks

    An oversight in early content block development for v3.0.0 left the
    `taxonomy-content-block` component reliant on the `grid` component.
    The `grid` component is difficult to style contextually in this case,
    as a the content block can be used in the primary or mobile nav.

    Now the `taxonomy-content-block` manages it's own layout, making it's
    layout much simpler to override, based on it's parent component.

*   Remove memoization in Sidekiq::CallbacksWorker

    This memoization got in the way when decorating CallbacksWorkers.
    Ex:
    decorated do
      sidekiq_options(enqueue_on: enqueue_on.merge(Review => :create))
    end

    wouldn't actually add anything to enqueue_on since it gets memoized
    before the new options are added.

*   Updates gsub to only swap out file extensions

    The gsub method for finding and running decorated test was swapping out
    the file name as well if it contained the string 'decorator' (i.e

    Before a page is cached by Turbolinks any takeovers must be destroyed. This avoids issues where the takeover will persist when a user navigates back through history.

    ECOMMERCE-4627
    Curt Howard

*   Raise error when running test:decorated when original can't be found

    If a test decoration couldn't be found when running test:decorated it

    misnamed we should raise an error and help the developer resolve the
    problem.

    Factories is included in the tests case super classes set up in the work
    area testing gem, at that point plugin factories haven't beed inlcuded

    - the only benefit of inline-list is that it adds display: inline-block; to the child LI elements. However, this adds specificity that doesn’t help when it comes to working with a responsive site.

    Remove left over icon in style_guides.scss
    Remove quotes for san-serif in style_guides.html.haml’s font-family key value.

*   Guard against change + input event chain for number inputs

    Chrome fires `change` events on mousemove when a user is interacting with the browser-supplied arrow UI on number fields, which is super weird and causes `WORKAREA.formSubmittingControls` to fire early and erratically. Guarding against the `change` event, specifically for inputs of type `number` fixes the issue.

*   Inject authenticity_token into every Ajax request

    To make sure all ajax calls from here on out are passing a CSRF
    token back to Rails (even if we don't currently `protect_from_forgery`
    on that request), we're now injecting the `X-CSRF-Token` header into all
    `jQuery.ajax` requests before they are sent. This allows developers to
    continue making Ajax requests and JS modules without needing to think
    about passing the CSRF token all the time.

    It also undoes a change that I made which only solved the problem for a
    single request. This solution can be credited to @sstaub, because she
    implemented it on Olympia and happened to notice that Shades of Light
    was also having the same problem.

    We used the following as a guide to creating this module: http://excid3.com/blog/rails-tip-2-include-csrf-token-with-every-ajax-request

    As of Rails 5.0.2, there is no more `bin/rails` when a `rails plugin` is
    generated. We no longer need the `gsub_file` calls currently in the
    plugin template as a fix for rails 4.x plugin generation, and removing
    it allows the plugin to generate successfully.

*   Return Unique set of style guide partials

    Style guide partials can come from several places and can be overridden
    in a host app.  This inadvertently caused the helper to concat all
    partial paths instead of returning the unique'd list of partials to be
    rendered.

    For example, a host app that overrode store front's
    color_pallete/_grays.html.haml partial would see gray rendered twice
    when they viewed style guide in their browser

    This change now respects overridden files and ensures files aren't
    duplicated when rendered.

*   Remove icon font in favor of SVGs

    Icon fonts have been a bear for many implementations. By universally
    using the `inline_svg` helper we've been able to reduce our dependency
    on them in favor of SVG images in the view layer.

    For the Stylesheet layer a new mixin has been created called `svg`. This
    mixin offers similar functionality to the previous `icon` mixin, but is
    significantly smaller and easier to understand.

    There is a slight distinction, in the filesystem, between regulard SVGs
    and SVGs that are intended to be used as icons.

    1. Icon SVG images live at the load path
    `weblinc/ENGINE/icons/NAME.svg`. They are intended to have no `fill`
    attribute applied to their markup, allowing the `inline_svg` helper to
    provide a class that style's the `fill` property of the image.
    2. All other SVGs behave as normal, containing whatever colors are
    needed for their appropriate presentation. Their load path is typically
    in the root image directory for the engine.

*   Create draft on render of content edit with new block to use as preview

    With content presets using the same mechanism as normal new blocks, the
    initial preview was showing the block type default data over the custom
    values copied from the preset. By creating a draft and using that as the
    initial preview, it ensures the block always reflexs the data presented
    in the form.

    When the graph of discounts is a complete graph; ie every discount is

    `.addBack()` the `[data-analytics]` selector so that analytics events

    Our offering for the 'hero banner' content block type didn't have any way of updating
    the alt text attribute for the image selected - it was alawys and empty string.

    Alt text is important for SEO and accesibility reasons, there for it should
    be open for customization in the admin to reflect better information for
    it corresponding image.

    We now provide the ability for admin to update hero banner content blocks alt-text; this input
    is intended to be optional.

    Poltergeist must be bumped for compatibility with the newer version of PhantomJS.

    PhantomJS has added an in-memory page cache, so we must clear this before tests. When testing the same page, a manual cache expiration is necessary.

    Previously we had two instances of jQuery UI sortable interacting with
    one another, which technically worked, but allowed both areas to be

    When an admin user tries to edit a navigation link in the admin, there is no way for them to see where the
    link currently points to.  This alleviates that problem to make it easier on the admin.

*   Add minitest support

    This functionality gives several big wins:
     * Automatic test suite upgrading
     * Decoratable tests

    All tests will be moved to Minitest for v3.0, this converts a handful to serve as a preview for what's to come. This also gives curious developers something to get their feet wet.

    Mild gotcha to use this functionality: to correctly set Rails.env when running rake workarea:test, workarea must be required before Bundler.require in config/application.rb. We make use of the same hack Rails does to make this possible. Currently, the app generator places workarea requires after Bundler.require, but this will change in v3.0.

*   Support decorators in any directory with .decorate extension

    This makes it easier to see customizations in an app without having to jump around different directories. This will be the only way to decorate with the release of v3.0.

    For example, if you want to decorate Workarea::Catalog::Product, you would create a file at #{Rails.root}/app/models/workarea/catalog/product.decorate with the contents:
        module Workarea
          decorate Catalog::Product do
            # my decorations
          end
        end

    *.decorator files are just Ruby, and editors will need to be updated to use Ruby settings on these files. *.decorator files are loaded _after_ decorators in app/decorators.

*   Fix pagination.js page-footer bug

    This bug occurs intermittantly on builds. The issue manifests itself as
    a floating `.page-footer` component that appears in the middle of a set
    of paginated results.

    This occurs because, on unload of a page that contains pagination, the
    view's height is being cached in `window.history.state` to be recalled
    when a user navigates back to the page. This is done to preserve their
    spot on the page when the brower's back functionality is triggered.

    The solution is to ensure that the view's height is cleared after 750ms,
    in the same way we handle page scrolling aspect of the module. This way
    the static height is _always_ removed.

*   Avoid elasticsearch deprecation warnings

    Elasticsearch (the gem) version 2.0 was released on July 20. The release
    includes deprecation warnings for methods not compatible with version 2
    of Elasticsearch (the database).

    Since Workarea applications use Elasticsearch (the database) version 1.x,
    these warnings are irrelevant and a nuisance. We don't depend on
    elasticsearch explicitly, but we do depend on elasticsearch-persistence
    which optimistically depends on elasticsearch > 0.4, resulting in
    Bundler resolving to elasticsearch 2.0.

    Explicitly constrain elasticsearch to < 2.0 to avoid these warnings.

    Currently our calls to asset thumbnails call the optim

    Call the correct image processor directly, rather than
    doubling up processor calls. This allows for efficient
    retrieval of the correct processed job and ensures
    caching.

*   Fix dev-only issue when adding products to the cart

    An issue was reported that an Uncaught TypeError appears, in
    development, when a user is adding a product to the cart. This seems to
    only occur when an SI is jumping around to many branches during a
    project's development. Sometimes the product data changes on them,
    causing them to have to reseed. This error then acts as a false-flag, as
    they assume there is something wrong with the drawer and not the cart,
    where the real problem lies.

    The fix simply ensures that a passed argument is a jQuery Collection
    before trying to treat it as such.

*   Overhaul page-content component

    `.page-content` was originally written to work relatively automagically.
    This caused a lot of confusion in the code and disallowed implementers
    the ability to customize without totally overhauling this component at
    the project level.

    This was solved by simplifying the component and rewriting it to follow
    the path a developer would take to customize. This means that the layout
    of this component is now dependant on the classes applied to the
    `application` or `checkout` layout file, which is a more natural
    flow for developers.

    Another big upshot of this work is that we are able to conditionally
    show the page's aside depending on what layout it's part of. Now, during
    checkout by default, the order totals table is available for mobile.

    If a Product contained too many filter values the edit view's layout
    would be compromised, since there was no natural way to wrap the

    browser with a natural way of wrapping the text in this area.

    The styling of the message displayed after a successful bulk upload was

It was considered invalid because the "price" property contained a symbol and the "priceCurrency" field was missing. This commit moves the "$" symbol outside of the "span" that contains the product's price and adds a "meta" tag that contains the price's currency.

*   Prevent NaN errors in date fields on back button in Safari

    In production only, the datetimepicker fields module
    is being re-run on page load after a back button press
    and is trying to use the cached, already-localized ("pretty") value
    as its starting value. In Safari, this creates an Invalid Date object,
    which is converted to NaN values by strftime.

    Provide opportunity to return from the setLocalizedDate function
    before updating the field value. This fixes the safari production
    edge case where the initial value comes from the browser cache
    rather than the iso8601 value provided by the server, and the module
    re-initializes anyway.

    2.) Alternatively, passing an option to the **save** method will disable
    publishing during a save action, similar to the `validate: false`
    convention ported from ActiveRecord (and Mongoid):

            model.save publish: false

    I feel like the second choice there will be used more often, but I'd
    like to have the block too both for backwards compatibility and because
    you might need to execute multiple lines of code without publishing. But
    that is somewhat flexible...

*   Unit tests are executable after being generated

    Currently, the decorator generator in 2.2 will generate verbatim model
    specs from the engine it finds the implementation code in. However, this
    causes problems if your spec files use the `rails_helper` rather than
    the `spec_helper`, which we seem to be implementing as a company. The
    generator will now gsub out `require 'spec_helper'` for
    `require 'rails_helper'`, so that generated specs can be run
    immediately and to ensure correctness on the implementing developer's
    part.

*   Add explicit require to generated sample_data

    Generated SampleData creators don't explicitly require
    `workarea/sample_data` at the top of the file, which can cause issues if
    you're doing anything but tacking the creator onto the end of the
    swappable list. If you attempt to swap, insert_before/after, or delete,
    you'll run into a `LoadError` when Ruby tries to autoload the constant
    that was referenced.

    For example, this will fail:

    ```ruby
    module Workarea
      module SampleData
        class Foos
          def perform
            Foo.create_all!
          end
        end

        creators.swap Products, Foos
      end
    end
    ```

    But this will work:

    ```ruby
    require 'workarea/sample_data'

    module Workarea
      module SampleData
        class Foos
          def perform
            Foo.create_all!
          end
        end

        creators.swap Products, Foos
      end
    end
    ```

    The reasoning behind this is because the SampleData file will also
    create the `creators` SwappableList and load in all of the required
    constants, so you can just begin working and not have to worry about
    loading your particular code..

*   Account for locale when defining predicate methods

    Mongoid defines predicate methods for each `field` you specify in the
    model class definition, in addition to accessors so that the fields can
    be modified. These predicates, which are basically the field name with a
    '?' on the end, return +true+ or +false+ depending on whether the field
    is present in the document or not (e.g., the value of the field is not
    `null`). For localized attributes, however, this method would always
    return `true` if it had been set at any time, since localization is
    implemented in Mongoid by converting each attribute value into a nested
    JSON object, with each key representing a locale and each value
    representing the attribute value for that given locale (using the `I18n`
    library to fall back locales in the same way the rest of the Rails app
    works).

    This patch is essentially a copy/paste of the Mongoid fixes made by
    Emily Stolfo, which can be seen in its original form on the Mongoid
    JIRA, and on GitHub:

*   Add analytics feature test

    By opening up the `WORKAREA.analytics.events` array as a public property
    on the module we are able to return it's contents to rspec and assert
    that each key in the event hash is present and reporting correctly.

*   Add default modal overlay styles and implementation example

    Platform currently uses non-modal dialogs by default, with the
    option to pass in settings via data attribute. However, once
    `modal: true` is activated, there are no functional styles
    included for the overlay.

    Additionally, there is no included reference for how to set up
    the data attribute with options hash correctly.

    Include default styles for `.ui-widget-overlay` and jsdoc
    example for `data-dialog-button` options.

*   Redirect to cart on xhr requests with expired checkout

    When checkout expires, ajax requests which are designed to replace
    sidebar content insert the cart page into the sidebar instead.
    Flash message is rendered inside sidebar as well.

    Add logic to checkouts controller to change the window location
    via js upon receiving expired xhr requests, recreating the same
    experience as a non-xhr request.

    Add 422 status to prevent js from replacing content prior to redirect.

    Add request spec

*   Generate decorators and unit tests

    Currently, devs must manually create the decorator file and copy over
    the unit tests whenever they wish to decorate an existing Workarea
    platform component. This adds a generator called 'workarea:decorator'
    whose job it is to create the generated decorator file with sane
    defaults, then copy over the decorated class's respective unit tests so
    that we can get faster feedback when existing functionality has been
    changed.

Workarea 2.1.3 (2016-04-06)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Do not display pagination markup for 0 pages

    The shared pagination partial is currently not rendered when there
    is only 1 page of results to display, but values of 0 are not currently
    accounted for. The partial will be rendered for an empty collection,
    resulting in erratic behavior and unnecessary js initialization.

    Update conditional to display pagination only for collections
    with greater than 1 page.

    ECOMMERCE-2461
    Kristen Ward

*   Handle customization attributes with a space character

    When passing in attributes to instantiate a `Customizations` class, the attributes are all converted to instance variables. This works for attribute names that are already valid identifier but if an attribute has a space in it (i.e. "A Test") it is not considered a valid identifier. By calling `#systemize` on the attribute name, it will be converted to a `String` that is a valid identifier.

    Decorators are being loaded in a different order in different
    environments. The root cause is the cache_classes logic that is removed
    in this commit. I'm unable to determine why this was there in the first
    place, so this change terrifies me. I'm not even sure we should be
    releasing it as patch, as it has the potential to break apps that were
    depending on the inconsistency.

    When viewing revenue graph for 7-90 day date periods, the times
    start and end in 24 hour intervals back from the present time. This
    causes confusion around the reported values for that time segment.

    Update revenue graph so that time segments start at 12:00 am
    and end at 11:59 pm.

    Clean up dashboard view via helper, remove multiple calls to Time.now

    Increase 7-90 day range end times to end of current day, so that
    step is consistent and revenue totals accurate. date ranges include
    the full current day.

    This work changes the release calendar from a traditional calender to a
    browse-by-week calendar. The calendar now shows one previous week, the
    current week, and two following weeks.

*   Fix checkout addresses view model to always return a shipping address when asked

    This is a more robust fix, with a cheaper test.

    ECOMMERCE-2215
    Ben Crouse

*   Check if shipping_address.errors should display

    When an order doesn't require shipping current_checkout#shipment is nil.
    Storefront::Checkout::AddressesViewModel#shipping_address calls
    shipment.address. The addresses.html.haml view properly checks if
    order_requires_shipping? except when outputting errors. Without
    javascript and digital only products, submitting an invalid billing
    address breaks the application.

    ECOMMERCE-2215

*   Improve algorithm for email recommendations

    This switches from using the same personalized results on the storefront to the following fallback system:

    1) Products also purchased with products in this order, sorted by sales

    2) Related products to products in the order

    3) Top sellers

*   Update ContentBlockTypeGenerator for new APIs

    After some changes were made to the way we test and implement generators
    on the Workarea platform, the ContentBlockGenerator looked a bit
    out-of-date. This updates the generator for the new APIs and renames it
    to ContentBlockTypeGenerator, to better reflect what it's actually
    creating.

    - Rename ContentBlockGenerator to ContentBlockTypeGenerator
    - Don't generate sample data in ContentBlockTypeGenerator.
    - Use the new `Plugin.append_stylesheets` method to append the newly
      generated stylesheet.
    - Modify ViewModel template to implement +locals+.

*   Adjust step size for revenue graph with small amounts of data

    If the graph has less than 6 minutes of data, make the step size
    equal to the amount of available time. Once the available time
    hits 6 minutes, the step size returns to 3 minutes.

*   Clean up/standardize generator implementations and testing

    After being worked on by different people and implemented and tested
    inconsistently, this work makes several changes:

    *   Remove need for generator_spec. The tests for serveral of the generators
        wasn't actually testing anything because this gem has some bugs. I've fixed
        the "broken" tests.

    *   Simplify content block generator spec to remove some of the excessive
        complication. Lost functionaly will be made up for with new functionality
        where the sample data creation automatically loads sample data classes from
        host application.

    *   Hack around the annoying missing bin/rails message. This was happening
        because of the discount generator, which calls another generator.

*   Fix discounts granted to orders with empty items

    This additional rule is a guard against granting discounts when an
    order doesn't have any relevant items. For example, don't give
    free shipping if the discount is set to ignore sale items and
    there are only sale items in the order.

    ECOMMERCE-2154

*   Add generator for new discounts

    Generates a new `Pricing::Discount` model, `Admin::Discounts` view
    model, and the proper Haml admin views for editing the new discount.

    developer, and provides inline comments to aid the developer in creating

*   Add SampleData generator

    This generator adds a new sample_data script, which is used to generate
    custom sample data for Workarea applications. Sample data is usually used
    in the development and testing phases, but can also be used to seed the
    database in non-local deployments of the app.

*   Fix context-menus within model-summaries

    A previous fix was applied to ensure that `context-menu` components
    found within `model-summary` components wouldn't cause the entire page
    to have a long horizontal scroll. The fix unfortunately trimmed off the
    `context-menu` when it was expanded. This patch fixes the issue
    correctly.

*   Allow decorating of parent and child classes

    Decorating a parent and child class can cause errors depending on the
    order the decorators are loaded.  When the parent class is decorated
    first, the decoration of the child class will thrown an error from
    inheriting the prepended module.  By added the target name to the
    generated modole parent and child decorations will not name clash.

*   Add translations for authentication flash messages

    In the `Workarea::Authentication` controller concern, the flash messages
    displayed when a user is not logged in (or a user must be logged out)
    are not translated, and thus result in English text appearing no matter
    what locale has been set. This change copies the hard-coded flash
    message text from `Workarea::Authentication` into the core english locale
    file, and replaces the text with calls to `I18n.t`.

    The previous heading solution actually went against the architecture,
    but by introducing a `heading` mixin we are able to provide congruency
    between the `base/_headings.scss` file and the `trumps/_heading.scss`
    file.

    - `$heading-1-font-size` through `$heading-6-font-size` variables have
      now been compressed into a `$heading-font-sizes` Sass map variable.
    - `core/trumps/_heading.scss` has been replaced by unique `storefront`
      and `admin` `trumps/_heading.scss` files.
    - `heading` style guide entry updated

*   Add `rake workarea:lint` to lint the current implementation

    The base implementation checks current data for possible problems to help with
    data integrations. We can expand the use of the workarea:lint rake task in the
    future to include code introspection as well.

    To add a custom linter from either a project or plugin, simply drop a file in
    the lib/workarea/lint directory, and define a class that inherits from
    Workarea::Lint in that file. See core/lib/workarea/lint for examples.

*   Add teaspoon test for dialog.js

    `WORKAREA.url` now contains two new methods:

    - `WORKAREA.url.current()` gets the current `window.location.href` value
    - `WORKAREA.url.redirectTo(url)` sets the current `window.location` value

    Because of the protected nature of the `window` host object, these
    methods were needed to be able to stub their return values in tests.
    They also serve as helpful aliases for developers.

*   Fix cloning bug in `WORKAREA.drawer.createFromFragment`

    `createFromFragment` was passing a jQuery object to the `create` method,
    which expects a String containing the HTML content that should be
    displayed.

    This commit also satisfies jshint warnings in `drawer.js` and
    `drawer_buttons.js` and fixes a typo in the thrown exception within
    `WORKAREA.drawerButtons.handleOpenAction`.

*   Fix bug to close mobile nav drawer when clicking X button

    Due to the recent refactor of `WORKAREA.drawer` and the way
    `WORKAREA.mobileNavChildMenus` replaces the default actions for the
    drawer used by the mobile navigation, attempting to close the drawer by
    clicking the X button began to throw an error.

    This was fixed by explicitly binding each button's action when the
    mobile nav drawers actions are replaced.

    When using a custom `readyEvent` in the drawer module, the originating
    `$source` object is now passed along to the event handler, which is
    helps to bridge the API gap between a module that customizes the default
    drawer offering and the drawer module itself.

*   reset publish_at when publishing a release

    In order to ensure that scheduled releases that have been published
    show up in the list of archived/completed releases, the `publish!`
    method no longer checks wether or not the `publish_at` date is in the
    future.

    Adam Clarke

*   Update base to be compatible with Modernizr v3:

    Modernizr v3 released and officially dropped support for v2. The upgrade
    from v2 to v3 causes some breaking changes in our platform, namely:

    - To utilize the `.no-js` class hook alongside a custom prefix, the
      class hook must be renamed `.modernizr-no-js`
    - The `.modernizr-(no-)touch` test has been renamed to
      `.modernizr-(no-)touchevents`

    This commit sees these modifications in base, along with the dependent
    version of `workarea-modernizr-rails` bump to v2.0.0.

    ECOMMERCE-1961
    Curt Howard

*   Add explicit dependency on sprockets-rails 2

    sprockets-rails 3 was released Dec 17 and is incompatible with Workarea.
    Since we don't specify an explicit dependency on sprockets-rails,
    Bundler is resolving to sprockets-rails 3, which prevents the app from
    starting.

    Add an explicit dependency on sprockets-rails 2 to resolve the issue.

    Ben Crouse

*   Add append point for user context menu

    ECOMMERCE-1877
    Matt Duffy

*   Separate system content from dynamic content in sample data

    This will allow a build to more gracefully customize system data
    without need to decorate/override all the dynamic data loading code.

    ECOMMERCE-1860
    Ben Crouse

*   Limit sample data category names to 2 words

    ECOMMERCE-1860
    Ben Crouse

*   Rename marketing pages to browsing pages

    This helps connect the fact that those sample data pages will
    end up in the browsing navigation.

    ECOMMERCE-1860
    Ben Crouse

*   Ensure sample data pages have unique names

    ECOMMERCE-1860
    Ben Crouse

    ECOMMERCE-1860
    Ben Crouse

*   Fix yield return value logic for determining search template

    ECOMMERCE-1931
    Ben Crouse

*   Improve sample data generator

    This commit reduces the complexity of the sample data generation as well
    renaming it to reduce confusion with rails generators. Decoupling the
    individual pieces of sample data will make it easier to implementations
    to override individual parts for their build.

    We've also switched to using Faker as much as it makes sense to.

    ECOMMERCE-1860
    Ben Crouse

*   Change presentation of navigation_menus#edit dialog

    ECOMMERCE-1691
    Curt Howard

*   Document CSS Architecture

    ECOMMERCE-1880
    Curt Howard

*   Ensure product results are shown when filtering search

    The search results were displaying content when filters would narrow
    the product results below the number of content results. This prevents
    the defaulting to content search when product filters are present.

    ECOMMERCE-1931
    Matt Duffy

*   Add discount application group calculation

    To fix incorrect discount calculation based on calculation ordering, we need to
    calculate each combination of discounts to determine the best value. These
    value calculations are each done and then undone and the best valued discount
    group is applied.

    ECOMMERCE-1866
    Ben Crouse

*   Rename vertical-rhythm -> visual-rhythm

    ECOMMERCE-1933

*   Move visually-hidden trump styles to payment-icon

    ECOMMERCE-1933
    Curt Howard

*   Ensure shipping option is valid on address update

    There were scenarios in which a shipping method could be selected,
    and then later become invalid when the user changed their shipping
    address. They could then skip over the shipping step and retain
    the now invalid shipping options.

    This fix ensures on address save that the selected shipping option
    is still valid.

    ECOMMERCE-1932
    Curt Howard

*   Fix autocompletion not matching on partial words

    This was because of the ES query type. This commit changes to use a
    prefix match like the jump to functionality if the request is xhr.

    ECOMMERCE-1928
    Ben Crouse

*   Add separate translations for html/text email areas

    ECOMMERCE-1794

    ECOMMERCE-1929
    Curt Howard

*   ECOMMERCE-1860: remove data dependencies from category queries
    Adam Clarke

*   Fix query parameter length for Category UI preview

    When a Category rule is added or modified the Category UI preview
    updates by submitting the serialized data of the surrounding form. When
    there are many manual products saved for a Category, the query string
    becomes very long, potentially causing a 412 server error.

    This commit removes the manual product IDs from the `$.get` request,
    since they are not needed to properly render the rule-based preview.

    ECOMMERCE-1916
    Curt Howard

*   Rename model method for accuracy

    ECOMMERCE-1556
    Ben Crouse

    ECOMMERCE-1918
    Curt Howard

*   Hide unwanted page headings instead of removing them

    Don't allow admins to remove the H1 from a content page. Visually hide
    it instead. This will prevent admins from unwillingly harming SEO.

    Duplicate H1s are unlikely since the HTML content block is the only type
    that allows adding an H1 to the page's content. A missing H1 is
    therefore the bigger risk.

    ECOMMERCE-1556
    Chris Cressman

*   Fix alignment of form controls when invalid

    When jQuery Validate applied the class `.value__error` to the
    `.text-box` component it also applied a `display: block` property value,
    which broke the tabular layout in the admin. This fix conditionally
    styles labels differently from text boxes.

    Comments have been improved for both engine's `.value` components as
    well.

    ECOMMERCE-1908
    Curt Howard

*   Add render H1 toggle to content pages

    This removes the need for H1 management in templates and allows us to
    remove the landing template since after this change, it provides no value.

    ECOMMERCE-1556

    Kristen Ward

*   Fix Load More Results button placement in pagination

    ECOMMERCE-1905
    Curt Howard

*   Fix items with 0 pending quantity

    Previously item ids would be included in the pending hash with 0, which
    is extraneous and/or irrelevant info.

    ECOMMERCE-1903
    Ben Crouse

*   Render the layout for XHR requests if layout=true

    This allows XHR requests to be made with the full layout while still
    considered XHR requests from the server's perspective. This is in
    contrast to removing the X-Requested-With header.

    ECOMMERCE-1854
    Ben Crouse

*   Patch dialog fragment to remove X-Requested-With

    This ensures the server will render the request exactly as the page
    would be rendered for a non-XHR request.

    ECOMMERCE-1854
    Ben Crouse

*   Remove unnecessary prefilter

    This is no longer needed since we are correctly using Vary headers
    to vary the cache based on the X-Requested-With

    ECOMMERCE-1854
    Ben Crouse

*   Begin new content block guides

    ECOMMERCE-1678

    This commit includes:

    - Move `grid` from components to `objects`
    - Add `responsive-grid` object
    - Removal of fieldsets from `checkout#addresses`
    - Add more classes to `checkout#shipping`
    - Modernize the `clearfix` trump
    - Secondary payments now visible by default, removes
      `checkout_secondary_payments.js`

*   Add ping to home base on application initialization

    ECOMMERCE-1253
    Ben Crouse

*   Create consistency with use of `facet` or `filter`

    The terms `facet` and `filter` were used in mixed scenarios throughout
    the codebase. This aims to make the use of either term consistent.

    `facet` is used in the context of search results, when referring to a list
    of filter values. `filter` is used to refer to lists of attributes that are
    used to narrow search results.

    Without this fix, cancellations adds an entry in the return value
    even if the quantity cancelled on the item is 0

    ECOMMERCE-1898
    Kristen Ward

*   Adjust JS Modules

    `release_search_for_editing.js` became
    `releasable_model_search_forms.js`.

    `releases_timelines.js` has been made less fragile.

    `search_results_sortables.js` has been cleaned up.

*   Refactor checkout code

    With intent to make extension and customization of checkout for
    host applications, the checkout steps and controller actions are
    broken into smaller pieces that allow easier customization of
    the checkout flow.

    ECOMMERCE-1765
    Matt Duffy

*   Rewrite pagination.js

    Pagination needed to be rewritten in order to support future development
    of Ajax Browse/Search Filtering. This change also improves this module's
    readability, squashes a bug that was frequently reported regarding it's
    use of Waypoints.js & removes the final, needless `$.get` request per
    page.

    ECOMMERCE-1873
    Curt Howard

*   Remove landing page type

    Base now ships with only one page template by default: generic. The
    logic has been retained so that SIs may still extend the previous
    functionality to create other page templates as needed.

    ECOMMERCE-1556
    Curt Howard

*   Disable analytics.js while editing content

    The analytics module would misfire many times during the process of
    editing content. This commit stops the analytics module from firing
    false positives while updating page content.

    ECOMMERCE-1733
    Curt Howard

*   Generalize range filters for FilterManager

    This updates the logic around building elasticsearch aggregation for
    price ranges and generalizes it to allow for the addition of any number
    of filters with range values.

    string in the redirect path.

*   Update & simplify style guides

    This commit sees the removal of the distincition between designer &
    deveolper modes, which was creating confusion around their intended
    uses.

    All layers of the ITCSS architecture are now accounted for in the style
    guide's structure for each engine.

    Arbitrary margins have been removed around each component to showcase if
    the component carries it's own, intentional margin.

    Some style guides have been updated to show their modifiers with the
    parent block, for reasons of convenience.

    ECOMMERCE-1671
    Curt Howard

*   Add worker to keep product browse index fresh

    This serves as a safety net to ensure we don't end up with stale product

    Removing the poor original assumption it may be useful to allow the
    admin and storefront to be mounted independently of one another. In
    practice, this is never done and just complicates code and testing.

*   Fix no products filter on category dependency on browse indexing

    When you add products to a category, the ES entry for the category does
    not get correctly updated because it depends on the product browsing
    index, which isn't necessarily updated yet. The solution here is to
    force index the first product in the category if present before
    continuing on to index the category admin entry.

    ECOMMERCE-1749
    Ben Crouse

*   Move i18n icon into related text-box

    The `i18n_icon` helper has been removed in favor of a modifier of
    `text-box--i18n` on all associated `text-box` components. The styling
    for the modifier is conditional, and will only display it's icon if a
    class of `i18n` is found higher in the modifiers ancestor tree.
    Currently the `i18n` class is output on the `html` element of the
    admin's application layout.

*   Refactor search router for easier extension

    This commit changes the Search::Router from a big, hairy if statement to
    a chain of middleware using our SwappableList class. This will allow

    plugins.

*   Move feature_spec_helper.js to immediately follow Modernizr

    In the test environment, feature_spec_helper.js is needed to undo
    certain Modernizr behavior. We allow plugins to insert code between
    Modernizr and feature_spec_helper in the head.js manifest, which may
    lead to bugs in the test environment.

    In the head manifest, move feature_spec_helper to immediately follow
    Modernizr.

*   Test for existing WORKAREA.config object before creating it

    In workarea.js, we test for an existing `WORKAREA` object before defining
    one so that an SI can establish the WORKAREA namespace earlier in the
    document if necessary. However, we don't offer the same courtesy for the
    `WORKAREA.config` object.

    Test for `WORKAREA.config` before defining it so that we don't overwrite
    it if it already exists.

*   Replaces added to cart dialog with drawer

    Clicking add to cart on both PDP and quick view will
    no longer open a dialog to confirm the add to cart. It
    now opens up the cart drawer with the flash messages within.

    This required a refactoring of how the drawers module was
    written in order to eliminate the need for a secondary ajax
    call to load the cart summary after the request to add the
    cart items.

*   Reduce CSS footprint in storefront

    This commit removes much of the accumulated cruft and opinionated
    styling from the storefront, while making the remaining amount of CSS
    as configurable as possible.

    A true objects layer has been added:

    - `objects/_button.scss`: contains baseline styling for `.button` and
      `.text-button`. Can be used to remove the styling for stray `button`
      elements.
    - `objects/_unstyled_list.scss`: removes browser default styling for
      lists.
    - `objects/_inline_list.scss`: does the same as the above, but makes
      internal `li` elements `display: inline-block`.

    The mixins offering has expanded to include:

    - `grid`: used in `components/_grid.scss` and for responsive grid
      one-offs.
    - `icon`: consolidates previous `icon-container` and `icon` mixins

    Some modules have been reinvisoned and/or simplified considerably. Those
    worth noting are as follows:

    - `components/_button.scss`: simply defines the CSS responsible for the
      design, relying on `objects/_button.scss` for the baseline styling.
    - `components/_text_button.scss`: same as above
    - `components/_grid.scss`: relies on `grid` mixin. `.grid--2-at-medium`
      has been removed.
    - `components/_message.scss`: simplified to be much closer to the admin.
    - `components/_page_content.scss`: defined by a two column grid with a
      gutter. Rewritten to use general sibling selectors, simplifying the
      file considerably.
    - `components/_page_header.scss`: simplified as much as possible, with
      respsect to the fact that this file is going to be heavily customized
      on a per-project basis.
    - `components/_product_details_container`: conditional overrides
      removed, simplified.

    The `storefront/application.scss.erb` file has two additional append
    points, one for `dependencies` (for plugins who leverage a rails
    front-end gem dependency) and `theme` where the bulk of the style
    overrides should take place as themes are being created.

    Many minor adjustments have been made to the storefront views in

*   Prevent nil regular prices

    The admin guards against empty regular price submissions, but the
    API does not. To ensure that regular price is never nil across the
    application, a before_validation callback is added to set regular
    price to 0 if its been set to nil.

*   Clean up reports after removing many of them

    After moving empty categories and product-data reports to filters
    in the search index, it doesn't really make sense to have a
    separate reports module.

    Resulting from changes in
    ECOMMERCE-1750 and ECOMMERCE-1749

*   Add product issues filter and replace missing images report

    ECOMMERCE-1750
    Ben Crouse

*   Move content assets sample data files

    Files to be used as content assets sample data are expected in the host
    app at `data/images/content`. However, this directory name is misleading
    since not all content asset files are images. Content assets sample data
    files within the workarea gem are expected at `data/assets` which is
    arbitrarily different from the host app location.

    Standardize on `data/content_assets` as the expected location within the
    host app and the workarea gem. This name maps to the corresponding model
    name and provides parity with `data/product_images` which is also used
    within the workarea gem.

    ECOMMERCE-1766
    Chris Cressman

*   Be consistent when saving asset paths on a content block

    Content block data sometimes includes asset paths. These paths should
    always refer to `Workarea::Content::Asset`s rather than files in
    `app/assets`. Each should also always include the asset host if one is
    configured so that developers can't omit the asset host in the view and
    cause performance problems.

    Asset paths are saved as data on content blocks primarily through (1)
    the asset picker UI and (2) sample data generators. The asset picker UI
    correctly uses `Workarea::Content::Asset`s, but it incorrectly excludes
    the asset host for non-image assets. The `BlockTypesGenerator` correctly
    includes the asset host, but incorrectly references assets in
    `app/assets`.

    Update both solutions to work consistently. For including the asset
    host, prefer the `url_to_asset` helper over the `image_url` and
    `asset_url` helpers. `image_url` is intended for use with images in
    `app/assets`, while `asset_url` can cause naming conflicts if the host
    app defines a 'Asset' resource.

    Ben Crouse

*   Run search index tasks for all locales.

    When building the ElasticSearch index, we were not truly respecting all
    locales configured in Rails' i18n and Workarea.config.locales, because we
    instantiated the Search::Repository (which defines what index we're
    placing the content in) *before* iterating through all of the locales.
    We need to place the instantiation code inside the `for_each_locale`
    loop to get this to work.

    Note that this does not seem to generate a Spanish-language admin
    index..

*   Switch to explicit discount compatibility

    Previous discounts were assumed to be compatible with each other
    unless marked as incompatible with specific discounts. This swaps
    this logic to assume incompatibility unless added as a compatible.

    This fits closer to the most common use cases for discounts, where
    most discounts are incompatible with all other discounts with a few
    exceptions.

*   Free gifts have a discount value

    Free gift discounts were not getting a value set when applying to
    an order. This made it impossible to choose among incompatible
    free gift discounts based on the value of the free gift.

    This changes it so that the sell price of the sku is used to set
    the discount value on free gifts.

*   Free gift discounts honor incompatibility rules

    When two free gift discounts qualified for an order, but the
    discounts were incompatible, both free gifts would remain on the
    order. This made it appear the discount incompatibility rules were
    being ignored.

    The logic in FreeGift was using a mutating #reject! to remove items,
    but this method does not correctly persist the mutated collection in
    mongodb. This fix explicity creates a new collection of items that
    is set on the order after removing the disqualified discount
    free gift.

*   Corrects the rendering of asset templates

    The content_assets#index action was being used for both the admin
    index page and insertion of assets into content blocks. Both uses
    caused an xhr request to the index action, but required different
    templates to render.

    This ticket resolves this conflict by creating a second action for
    asset insertion, rather than overusing the index action that resulted
    in the wrong template being rendered on the index page for secondary
    pages.

*   Consolidate locale config to one place.

    Workarea currently requires locale configuration to be defined
    twice...first in the application config itself and then in the workarea
    initializer. The reasoning behind this was so one could customize the
    name of the language in the locale selector. However, it's much more
    conventional to place this translation text in each locale file,
    allowing us to only configure locales in application.rb.

*   Configuration & API Cleanup in JavaScript

    Configuration added to:

      - core:
        + jumpToMenuFields
        + deletionForms
        + messages
        + pagination
      - admin:
        + dateRangePickers
        + productImagesSortables
        + recommendationsSortables
        + searchResultsSortables

    Configuration files now have three sections:
      - Module config, named after module
        + `WORKAREA.config.searchFields = {}`, for example
        + These objects wrap various properties used for configuration
      - Other configuration,
        + `WORKAREA.config.creditCardNumberWhiteList`, for example
        + Configuration for non-module specific uses
      + Config Methods
        + Extension methods, like Credit Card Validation for jQuery Validate

    Many methods were cleaned up. A few modules underwent light refactoring.

*   Validate `type_id` field on `Workarea::Content::Block`

    The `Workarea::Content::Block#type_id` field is used to determine which partial and which view model to use. Without this field, there will be errors when the content is loaded. Adding validation to this field prevents developers from creating content blocks without a type.

*   Refactor fulfillment to allow easier extension

    This work allows more flexibility for adding new fulfillment and order
    statuses by introducing the StatusCalculator. It also cleans up and
    simplifies the logic and modeling around the fulfillment functionality
    in the system.
