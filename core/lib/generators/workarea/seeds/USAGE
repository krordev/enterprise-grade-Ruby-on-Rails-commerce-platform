Description:
    Generate seeds, a script for manipulating the initial
    application state so that all members of a development team
    can work with the same data set in their own separate
    environments.

Example:
    rails generate workarea:seeds FeaturedProducts

    This will create:
        app/seeds/workarea/featured_products_seeds.rb
