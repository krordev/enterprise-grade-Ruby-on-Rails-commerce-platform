Description:
    Generates a new decorator for a given PATH in a Workarea platform
    component (or plugin), and a decorator for its unit test from the existing
    codebase in your host app.

Example:
    rails generate workarea:decorator app/models/workarea/search/storefront/product.rb

    This will create:
        app/models/workarea/search/storefront/product.decorator
        test/models/workarea/search/storefront/product_test.decorator (if a test exists)

    If no tests exist, it will also show a huge warning message stating the class you're
    about to decorate has NO tests, so anything you change must be also
    verified in the unit tests.
