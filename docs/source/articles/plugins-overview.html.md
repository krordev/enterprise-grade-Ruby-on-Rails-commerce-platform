# Plugins Overview

A Workarea plugin is a Rails engine used to add to or customize the features of the Workarea platform. Plugins allow code to be managed and maintained separately by different teams, in different repositories, and on different schedules. Plugins distribute the development of the platform so the core developers don't have to develop every feature a project may require.

Systems integrators (SIs) are encouraged to develop their own plugins to package features for re-use across projects or teams.
