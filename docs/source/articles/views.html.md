# Views

Workarea views are written in [Haml](http://haml.info/), but are otherwise no different from vanilla Rails views.

You do not need to stick with Haml when [overriding views](overriding.html). You may change the file extension and use whichever templating language you prefer and Rails will prefer your view over the same view from Workarea.

For HTML naming conventions and idioms used in Workarea, review the [stylesheet coding standards](stylesheet-coding-standards.html).
