Upgrade Guides
======================================================================

Upgrade guides highlight the most important changes for developers upgrading an application or plugin to a newer minor or major version of the Workarea platform.

When upgrading, also consider the [Workarea Upgrade](https://plugins.workarea.com/plugins/upgrade) plugin, which provides migration scripts, diffs, reports, and other tools to assist with Workarea upgrades.
