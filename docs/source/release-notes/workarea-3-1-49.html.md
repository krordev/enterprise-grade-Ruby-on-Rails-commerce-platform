# Workarea 3.1.49

Patch release notes for Workarea 3.1.49.

## Update Puma and Loosen Constraint

This gem is fairly stable and doesn't follow strict semantic versioning
anyways. Update to the latest Puma to enjoy its much improved reactor
internals that will help with concurrency on high traffic deployments.
