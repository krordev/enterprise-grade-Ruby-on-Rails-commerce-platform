# Workarea 3.4.20

Patch release notes for Workarea 3.4.20.

## Update Loofah to Gain Security Fixes

Loofah was updated due to [a security
vulnerability](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/171), so
it's been bumped in the Workarea dependencies to ensure that you won't
be bitten by an XSS bug in sanitized HTML.

### Pull Requests

- [185](https://github.com/workarea-commerce/workarea/pull/185)

## Increase Reliability of Admin Toolbar System Tests

Due to the usage of `<iframe>` in admin toolbar system tests, they would
fail intermittently since Chrome couldn't always click the element in an
Ajax-ed `within_frame` call. Modify the method in Capybara to also
`wait_for_xhr` prior to running any assertions.

### Pull Requests

- [171](https://github.com/workarea-commerce/workarea/pull/171)

## Fix Missing Aspect Ratio Attribute

Instead of trying to calculate the `#inverse_aspect_ratio` in Dragonfly,
use the `#aspect_ratio` field and calculate its inverse when requested.
