# Workarea 3.0.4

## Fixes the Storefront's Checkout Summary Partial

[Pull Request](https://stash.tools.weblinc.com/projects/WL/repos/workarea/pull-requests/2486/overview)

Workarea 3.0.4 fixes the Storefront's checkout summary partial, _workarea/storefront/checkouts/\_summary.html.haml_, to properly display the billing address during checkout. If your app is overriding this partial, you should apply the same fix in your copy of the file.
